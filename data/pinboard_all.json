This should prevent you in most cases from unexpectedly overwriting the origin.The only gotcha I see is if you do a git fetch and then without incorporating the fetched changes into your branch, do a git push --force-with-lease, you'll overwrite the remote changes. So you should still be careful even when using --force-with-lease, but it is an nice safety net to have to protect yourself from making embracing mistakes.<\/blockquote>","meta":"af4fb7b186850c519dbede256ecc7625","hash":"febee007fd8932b28dd6399e7adb5a3a","time":"2015-10-19T21:16:23Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"git tips development versioncontrol"},

For instance, the Snowden documents show that NSA\u2019s VPN decryption infrastructure involves intercepting encrypted connections and passing certain data to supercomputers, which return the key. The design of the system goes to great lengths to collect particular data that would be necessary for an attack on Diffie-Hellman but not for alternative explanations, like a break in AES or other symmetric crypto. While the documents make it clear that NSA uses other attack techniques, like software and hardware \u201cimplants,\u201d to break crypto on specific targets, these don\u2019t explain the ability to passively eavesdrop on VPN traffic at a large scale.<\/blockquote>","meta":"fb7a487b84c028eb609ed0f3abc3a5fd","hash":"cc712db78ecaaad9e94a36205da8bfa4","time":"2015-10-15T21:11:31Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"cryptography privacy security nsa encryption"},

In the late 1980's and early 1990's, I worked for Kmart behind the service desk and the store played specific pre-recorded cassettes issued by corporate. This was background music, or perhaps you could call it elevator music. Anyways, I saved these tapes from the trash during this period and this video shows you my extensive, odd collection.<\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Until around 1992, the cassettes were rotated monthly. Then, they were replaced weekly. Finally sometime around 1993, satellite programming was intoduced which eliminated the need for these tapes altogether.<\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>The older tapes contain canned elevator music with instrumental renditions of songs. Then, the songs became completely mainstream around 1991. All of them have advertisements every few songs.<\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>The monthly tapes are very, very, worn and rippled. That's becuase they ran for 14 hours a day, 7 days a week on auto-reverse. If you do the math assuming that each tape is 30 minutes per side, that's over 800 passes over a tape head each month.<\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Finally, one tape in the collection was from the Kmart 30th anniversary celebration on 3\/1\/92. This was a special day at the store where employees spent all night setting up for special promotions and extra excitement. It was a real fun day, the store was packed wall to wall, and I recall that the stores were asked to play the music at a much higher volume. The tape contains oldies and all sorts of fun facts from 1962.

{"href":"http:\/\/k-punk.abstractdynamics.org\/archives\/004807.html","description":"k-punk: Simon's interview with CCRU (1998)","extended":"<blockquote>Hungry for intellectual reasons-to-be-cheerful, CCRU simultaneously renounce postmodernism's wan fatalism (the idea that we're at the end of everything) and the guilt-wracked impotence of the Left. In the process, they've jettisoned the concept of \u201calienation\u201d in both its Marxist and Freudian senses. They speak approvingly of \u201csurplus value,\u201d sublimation and commodity-fetishism as creative tendencies. Where \u201cCyberpositive\u201d noted how how runaway capitalism had accessed \u201cinconceivable alienations,\u201d CCRU's collectively written essay \u201cSwarmachines\u201d goes further and climaxes with the boast: \u201calienated and loving it.\u201d The idea, says Fisher, comes from a mix-and-blend of Lyotard and Blade Runner\u2014\u201cthe proletariat as this synthetic class, and revolution that's on the side of the synthetic and artificial. The concept of \u2018alienation\u2019 depends on the notion that there's some authentic essence lost through the development of capitalism. But according to Barker, everything's already synthetic.\u201d If reality really is a bio-mechanical, geocosmic continuum, there's no reason to resist capitalism\u2019s escalating dynamic of anti-naturalism: addiction to hyper-stimulus, the creation of artificial desires.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>The mania of CCRU's texts\u2014with their mood-blend of euphoric anticipation and dystopian dread\u2014is contagious. Much of the time they're trying to create a \u201ctheory-rush\u201d that matches the buzz they get from contemporary sampladelic dance music; they describe, half-jokingly, what they do as \u201csub-bass materialism.\u201d \u201cThe musical model is really key to us,\u201d says Land. \u201cIt's absurd to say that music doesn't represent the real and therefore it\u2019s an empty metaphor. Every theorist who hasn\u2019t a real place for music ends up with one-dimensional melancholia.\u201d Not only do the CCRU derive a lot of their energy from music (specifically drum & bass and UK garage, which one member of the unit actually makes and Djs under the name Kode 9) but popular culture is where their ideas seem most persuasive. Right from its late Eighties beginnings, rave culture\u2019s motor has been anarcho-capitalist: from promoters throwing illegal parties in warehouses to drug dealing. Even after its co-optation by the record and clubbing industries, rave music's cutting edge comes from small labels, cottage-industry producers with home studios, specialist record stores, pirate radio.

By 1977, an Exxon senior scientist named James Black was, according to his own notes, able to tell the company\u2019s management committee that there was \u201cgeneral scientific agreement\u201d that what was then called the greenhouse effect was most likely caused by man-made CO2; a year later, speaking to an even wider\u00a0audience inside the company, he said that research indicated that if we doubled the amount of carbon dioxide in the planet\u2019s atmosphere, we would increase temperatures two to three degrees Celsius. That\u2019s just about where the scientific consensus lies to this day. \u201cPresent thinking,\u201d Black wrote in summary, \u201cholds that man has a time window of five to ten years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.\u201d<\/blockquote>","meta":"b544546b3aba239b9fbf5a2f7d941ce5","hash":"e6d95868817086f40324913c8c9e6428","time":"2015-09-22T15:09:52Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"climate weather oil capitalism"},

The most troubling numbers show up far beneath the upper echelons of higher education. Elite institutions prop up the overall average earnings of college graduates nationwide. Although earnings of college graduates continue to outpace those of non-collegians by a significant margin, at some institutions, the earnings of students 10 years after enrollment are bleak.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>The Department of Education calculated the percentage of students at each college who earned more than $25,000 per year, which is about what high school graduates earn. At hundreds of colleges, less than half of students met this threshold 10 years after enrolling. The list includes a raft of barber academies, cosmetology schools and for-profit colleges that often leave students with few job prospects and mountains of debt.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>But some more well-known institutions weren\u2019t far behind. At Bennington College in Vermont, over 48 percent of former students were earning less than $25,000 per year. A quarter were earning less than $10,600 per year. At Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, the median annual earnings were only $35,700. Results at the University of New Mexico were almost exactly the same.<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>The data reveals how much money students are borrowing in exchange for earnings after graduation. While U.C.L.A. and Penn State are both prestigious public research universities, recent U.C.L.A. grads leave with about 30 percent less debt, even as their predecessors are earning about 30 percent more money than counterparts at Penn State. Harvard students borrow barely a quarter of what Brandeis students take on, and earn nearly twice as much.<\/blockquote>\n","meta":"59c9a7f77c8aef52bb360b1ec38038eb","hash":"064e76d556c091dc1a474751094c478c","time":"2015-09-15T14:34:51Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"education america government capitalism"},

This left a complex legacy. During the Cold War, it was commonplace to draw the distinction between \u201ctotalitarian\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d societies by noting that only in the free ones could groups self-organize independently of the state. But many of the groups that made that argument\u2014including the magazines on this left\u2014were often covertly-sponsored instruments of state power, at least in part. Whether or not art and artists would have been more \u201crevolutionary\u201d in the absence of the CIA\u2019s cultural work is a vexed question; what is clear is that that possibility was not a risk they were willing to run. And the magazines remain, giving off an occasional glitter amid the murk left behind by the intersection of power and self-interest.

(Rent-controlled apartments can only be bequeathed to family members who were living in the unit for two years before the original tenant vacates it.) \u201cRent stabilization\u201d generally applies to apartments in buildings, built between 1947 and 1974, comprising six or more units. Both limit the amount by which landlords can increase tenants\u2019 rent when renewing leases; however, rents in rent-regulated apartments can still be increased incrementally over time and eventually, once they hit twenty-five hundred dollars per month\u2014and a tenant vacates the apartment\u2014they become \u201cderegulated,\u201d and can be listed at market prices.

Its freshwater wells were overpumped, frequently contaminated by brackish water or sewage.

He designed and built, with immigrant labor, a dam on the Croton River in Westchester County, and then sent the water south solely on gravity. It traveled 40 gently sloping miles through mains that dropped 13.25 inches every mile, pure, unfiltered water rolling stanza by stanza through a poem of civil engineering.<\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>It crossed from the mainland over the Harlem River at the High Bridge and continued to two reservoirs, including one built on what is now the site of the main public library. Croton water reached a fountain in City Hall Park and rose 50 feet, unpumped: gravity\u2019s geyser. The city grew tenfold in the 19th century and, following the Jervis plans, more water was brought from upstate into the city.<\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>For mid-19th-century New Yorkers, the High Bridge was in the country and a weekend destination that was a ferry ride away. \u201cThey came by the thousands on Sundays,\u201d said Sidney Hornstein, a geologist and historian of the city.<\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>North of the High Bridge, wealthy men raced their horse-drawn carriages on the Harlem River Speedway, built for their enjoyment. Alongside the speedway, at the river\u2019s edge, a sidewalk was built for the public at the insistence of Paul Dana, president of the parks department in 1890, who pleaded that the resource of a public park could not be squandered by not giving people a chance to get to the water.<\/blockquote>","meta":"d1aaf806cbd606d71d28d6bc93df1964","hash":"529173d382f2a61f1afd827ebbbdd661","time":"2015-06-10T14:48:33Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"water history nytimes nyc manhattan bronx"},

There is more variety in the Stars of '71 than in '70, as the Dead experiment with the structure.

These are also appropriately called \u201canonymous named pipes\u201d. Process substitution is implemented in most modern shells and can be used through the syntax <(command arg1 arg2). The shell runs these commands, and passes their output to a file descriptor, which on Unix systems will be something like \/dev\/fd\/11. This file descriptor will then be substituted by your shell where the call to <() was. Running a command in parenthesis in a shell invokes a seperate subprocess, so multiple uses of <() are run in parallel automatically (scheduling is handled by your OS here, so you may want to use this cautiously on shared systems where more explicity setting the number of processes may be preferable). Additionally, as a subshell, each <() can include its own pipes, so crazy stuff like <(command arg1 | othercommand arg2) is possible, and sometimes wise.<\/blockquote>","meta":"c3973e986d3db5d93ca5c1b1941e728b","hash":"ace57e25a07b3e6357a61fb3abf9f288","time":"2015-03-16T18:11:41Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"bash linux unix shell pipes streams"},

The park is located in the World Wildlife Fund-defined Northern short grasslands ecoregion, which spans much of southern Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, and the northern Great Plains states in the USA. The unique landscape and harsh, semi-arid climate provide niches for several adapted plants and animals. The park and surrounding area house the country's only black-tailed prairie dog colonies. Rare and endangered fauna found in the park include the pronghorn, greater sage-grouse, burrowing owl, ferruginous hawk, prairie rattlesnake, black-footed ferret and greater short-horned lizard. Flora includes blue grama grass, needlegrass, plains cottonwood and silver sagebrush.","meta":"018c86c1dd84d230c9253e491227305f","hash":"d69e5c61d44fbc9c9d98154b31ffdd1d","time":"2015-02-26T12:31:09Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"wikipedia nationalparks canada"},

{"href":"http:\/\/www.hayduketrail.org\/","description":"The Hayduke Trail Home Page","extended":"> The Hayduke Trail is an extremely challenging, 800-mile backcountry route through some of the most rugged and breathtaking landscapes on earth. Located entirely on public land, the trail links six of the National Parks on the Colorado Plateau in Southern Utah and Northern Arizona with the lesser known, but equally splendid, lands in between them. Encompassed in the route are Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon, Grand Canyon and Zion National Parks as well as Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and numerous National Forests, BLM Districts, Primitive Areas, Wilderness Areas and Wilderness Study Areas. The Hayduke Trail is not intended to be the easiest or most direct route through this incredibly varied terrain, but is rather meant to showcase the stunning Redrock Wilderness of the American Southwest. Named after George Washington Hayduke III, a fictitious character in Edward Abbey's novel The Monkey Wrench Gang, the trail seeks to pay homage to Abbey for his tireless defense of these fragile and threatened public lands and to heighten awareness and promote the conservation of the wild places that he and so many other people have come to need and love.","meta":"1a6347fc1a508dd08be5dfd8e42bb8b7","hash":"83e6f29673e30931d4c5a866edeffd02","time":"2015-02-23T16:08:02Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"west utah hiking arizona hayduke"},

In a small heavy skillet, toast cumin and coriander seeds until fragrant. In a mortar and pestle, or in a coffee grinder, grind to a powder and set aside.\r\n2. Meanwhile, roughly cut beef into 2-inch cubes, or slice it against the grain into pieces about 1\/4-inch thick by 1 1\/2 inches square.\r\n3. In a large, heavy pot over high heat, heat oil until shimmering. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, brown the meat, turning occasionally until crusty. Adjust heat to prevent scorching. As it is cooked, remove the meat to drain on paper towels. Add more oil as needed for browning, but do not clean out the pot.\r\n4. To the empty but crusty pot, add onion, garlic, jalape\u00f1os, masa harina or tortilla (if using), chile powder, cumin-coriander powder and oregano. Cook, stirring, until onion has softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add meat, beer, tomatoes, chocolate, whole dried chiles and 1 quart water. Bring to a gentle simmer and simmer about 1 1\/2 hours, or until meat is fork-tender. Remove the dried chiles.\r\n5. Serve immediately or let cool and refrigerate. The chili tastes best one or two days after it is made.\r\n6. Reheat over low heat if necessary and serve in bowls, sprinkled with chopped onion and cilantro. Add Fritos for crunch, or dip tortillas into the spicy gravy.","meta":"c62feae722d169a790f289ed9dd2e393","hash":"2169fbe7b6c8efc642bc85cb0a8b6989","time":"2015-01-27T14:39:00Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"recipes food chili meat nytimes"},

This trend is\u00a0a break from the historical pattern of diesel fuel prices usually being lower than gasoline prices except in cold winters when demand for heating oil pushed diesel fuel prices higher. The main reasons why diesel fuel prices have been higher than regular gasoline prices in recent years are:\r\n> \r\n> Demand for diesel fuel and other distillate fuel oils have been relatively high, especially in Europe, China, India, and the United States.\r\n> The transition to less polluting, lower-sulfur diesel fuels in the United States affected diesel fuel production and distribution costs.\r\n> The federal excise tax for on-highway diesel fuel of 24.4 cents\/gallon is 6 cents per gallon higher than the gasoline tax.","meta":"df591a567e329fbc7addfb7170144820","hash":"41536be17fec4c7205f2d93326c3ea56","time":"2015-01-26T14:24:23Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"economics diesel taxation fuel"},

Until 1972, when it was replaced by Interstate Highways west of the Sacramento area, it extended (by way of Stockton, the Altamont Pass, and the Bay Bridge) to San Francisco, near the Pacific Ocean. The Interstates were constructed later and are mostly separate from this route. It generally serves a corridor south of Interstates 70 and 80 and north of Interstates 64 and 40. The route runs through mostly rural desert and mountains in the Western United States, with the section through Nevada known as \"The Loneliest Road in America\". In the Midwest, US 50 continues through mostly rural areas of farms as well as a few large cities including Kansas City, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; and Cincinnati, Ohio. The route continues into the Eastern United States, where it passes through the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia before heading through Washington, D.C. From there, US 50 continues through Maryland as a high-speed road to Ocean City. Signs at each end give the length as 3,073 miles (4,946\u00a0km), but the actual distance is slightly less, due to realignments since the former figure was measured. US 50 passes through a total of 12 states (California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland) as well as the District of Columbia.","meta":"296d4e97af921cc7ec79f5de846781fa","hash":"b19670b2bc4e943418e77e28d8964068","time":"2015-01-21T22:52:27Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"roads usa wikipedia highway"},

He is a trained polyarnik, a specialist in the polar north, a meteorologist. In the past thirty years, he has lived on Russian ships and, more recently, in Khodovarikha, an Arctic outpost, where he was sent by the state to measure the temperatures, the snowfall, the winds. The outpost lies on a fingernail of a peninsula that juts into the Barents Sea. The closest town, by any definition, is an hour away by helicopter. He has a wife, but she lives far away, in Arkhangelsk. They have no children. On his rare visits to Arkhangelsk, he has trouble negotiating the traffic and the noise. Arkhangelsk is not Hong Kong. Korotki is sixty-three, and when he began his career he was an enthusiast, a romantic about the open spaces and the conditions of the Arctic. He watches the news on TV but doesn\u2019t fully believe it. Polyarniki were like cosmonauts, explorers for the Soviet state. There are fewer now. Who wants to live like this anymore?

Unix beat out the LISP machines. If you consider mobile handsets, many of which run descendants of Unix (iOS and Android), Unix beat out Windows as well. And HTML5 beat out all of the various initiatives to create a single unified web. It nods to accessibility; it doesn\u2019t get in the way of those who want to make something huge and interconnected.

The project embodies the tensions between consumers and producers, art and commerce, popular culture and its critical commentator, which obviously have gained the trio extraordinary popularity in both fashion and art circles, perceived as self-reflective meta-narrative. \u201cBetween art and fashion we\u2019re kind of taking advantage of what each one of them doesn\u2019t know about the other one, and then what both of them don\u2019t know about China,\u201d says Radboy, while emphasizing that although SB problematizes institutional critique in its performative gestures, they are in no way critically-distanced cultural commentators, elevated from the criticized phenomenon: \u201cIt\u2019s important to communicate that we\u2019re not a brand about Shanzhai \u2013 we are actual shanzhai; we\u2019re not commenting on something, we belong to the phenomenon.\u201d He continues: \u201cThe project is authentically commercial. We totally implicate ourselves in the real economies we work in. If there is a critique produced it is physically embedded in our products \u2014\u00a0the same way it is in shanzhai products; the objects contain a critique, but the producers are only interested in profit.\u201d Exploring the dynamics of marketing, SB challenges not only mainstream consumer culture, but the art market and its performed heroism as a cultural sector. Completely immersed in point-of-views without attempting to agree to any of them, SB is political through it\u2019s depoliticization; it\u2019s embodied politics as self-critical consumerism and meta art\/fashion-entertainment","meta":"91c3956560e970f7fe2751e383f8d513","hash":"b712c89fef320e12cb6661a27ff46eb7","time":"2014-11-09T14:58:18Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"future art capitalism globalism video"},

It replaced both the legendary 300 SL (W\u00a0198) and the 190 SL (W\u00a0121\u00a0BII). Of the 48,912 W\u00a0113 SLs produced, 19,440 were sold in the US.\r\n> \r\n> The W\u00a0113 SL was developed under the auspices of Mercedes-Benz Technical Director Fritz Nallinger, Chief Engineer Rudolf Uhlenhaut and Head of Styling Friedrich Geiger. The lead designers were Paul Bracq and B\u00e9la Bar\u00e9nyi, who created its distinctive, patented, slightly concave hardtop, which inspired the \"Pagoda\" nickname.\r\n> \r\n> All models were equipped with an inline-six cylinder engine with multi-port fuel injection. The bonnet, trunk lid, door skins and tonneau cover were made of aluminum to reduce weight. The comparatively short and wide chassis, combined with an excellent suspension, powerful brakes and radial tires gave the W\u00a0113 superb handling for its time. The styling of the front, with its characteristic upright Bosch \"fishbowl\" headlights and simple chrome grille, dominated by the large three-pointed star in the nose panel, paid homage to the then already legendary 300 SL roadster.\r\n> \r\n> W\u00a0113 SLs were typically configured as a \"Coupe\/Roadster\" with a soft-top and an optional removable hardtop. A 2+2 was introduced with the 250 SL \"California Coupe,\" which had a fold-down rear bench seat instead of the soft-top.","meta":"b3aa773f31559236a08d12277a5f9767","hash":"f7f5e4b5eac11cd4ec405dd8f7821b71","time":"2014-11-07T19:30:06Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"mercedes cars wikipedia"},

{"href":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Four-stroke_engine","description":"Four-stroke engine","extended":"> A four-stroke engine (also known as four-cycle) is an internal combustion engine in which the piston completes four separate strokes which constitute a single thermodynamic cycle. A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder, in either direction. The four separate strokes are termed:\r\n> \r\n> Intake: this stroke of the piston begins at top dead center. The piston descends from the top of the cylinder to the bottom of the cylinder, increasing the volume of the cylinder. A mixture of fuel and air is forced by atmospheric (or greater by some form of air pump) pressure into the cylinder through the intake port.\r\n> Compression: with both intake and exhaust valves closed, the piston returns to the top of the cylinder compressing the air or fuel-air mixture into the cylinder head.\r\n> Power: this is the start of the second revolution of the cycle. While the piston is close to Top Dead Centre, the compressed air\u2013fuel mixture in a gasoline engine is ignited, by a spark plug in gasoline engines, or which ignites due to the heat generated by compression in a diesel engine. The resulting pressure from the combustion of the compressed fuel-air mixture forces the piston back down toward bottom dead centre.\r\n> Exhaust: during the exhaust stroke, the piston once again returns to top dead centre while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent fuel-air mixture through the exhaust valve(s).","meta":"1baa202662caf40ed3ecbb68bd97d459","hash":"71281c938d96e7b24a56309493958b3a","time":"2014-11-03T21:26:09Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"engineering engines wikipedia"},

You can still get more expensive things delivered, or cheaper things delivered for a fee, or just Amazon things, but probably not coffee or one bowl of soup or laundry. Stopping by the coffee shop, in this future optimum urban utopia, is either an economic necessity or an affectation, either downscale or premium, like thrift shopping vs. vintage shopping. Environmental identities get muddled and flipped; previously important differences between affluent urban, suburban and rural lifestyles fade into the background. Cities, no longer the difficult but rewarding lifestyle alternative, become the easy option.","meta":"566db8281de14f858b6109ae8e02cf71","hash":"f0f1b9d12080c86972ab1548f9c69de5","time":"2014-10-31T16:29:37Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"cities urbanism future economy"},

She is also known as the earth\/time mother. In Inca mythology, Pachamama is a fertility goddess who presides over planting and harvesting. She causes earthquakes and is typically in the form of a dragon. She is also an ever present and independent deity who has her own self-sufficient and creative power to sustain life on this earth. Pachamama is the wife of Pacha Kamaq and her children are Inti, the sun god, and Killa, the moon goddess. In Quechua cosmology, these are the four organizing principles of nature based on water, earth, sun, and moon. Llamas as well as burned, elaborate miniature garments are sacrificed to her. After the conquest by Spain, which forced conversion to Roman Catholicism, the figure of the Virgin Mary became united with that of the Pachamama for many of the indigenous people. In pre-Hispanic literature, Pachamama is seen as a cruel goddess eager to collect her sacrifices. As Peru began to form into a nation, however, Pachamama began to be\u2013and to this day is\u2013perceived as being benevolent and giving. She is also seen as nature itself. Thus, problems arise when people take too much from nature because they are taking too much from Pachamama.","meta":"8a550dbd4363ca09d5fa618477120977","hash":"f162b719acca320c5124e86d7a2c957e","time":"2014-10-27T18:01:09Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"wikipedia religion america"},

The park and preserve covers 4,093,077 acres (6,395.43\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 16,564.09\u00a0km2), being roughly the size of Wales. Most of this is a designated wilderness area in the national park where all hunting is banned, including over 3,922,000 acres (1,587,000\u00a0ha) of land. The park is named after Mount Katmai, its centerpiece stratovolcano. The park is located on the Alaska Peninsula, across from Kodiak Island, with headquarters in nearby King Salmon, about 290 miles (470\u00a0km) southwest of Anchorage. The area was first designated a national monument in 1918 to protect the area around the major 1912 volcanic eruption of Novarupta, which formed the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, a 40-square-mile (100\u00a0km2), 100-to-700-foot-deep (30 to 213\u00a0m) pyroclastic flow.

A large part of the park is protected in the Gates of the Arctic Wilderness which covers 7,167,192 acres (2,900,460\u00a0ha).[3] The wilderness area adjoins the Noatak Wilderness Area and together they form the largest contiguous wilderness in the United States.","meta":"863ae42523c0355b50486fcb971b7409","hash":"52e6681f496517154b0670f2e93e8572","time":"2014-10-07T17:14:02Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"nationalparks wikipedia alaska"},

{"href":"http:\/\/pitchfork.com\/reviews\/albums\/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land\/","description":"Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror","extended":"> Ambient 4: On Land (1982) has been cited by both Eno and many fans as his best work. It's a complete realization of several artistic aims, and of all his albums it remains the most distinctive-- there are hardly any successful imitators of its unique universe. As Discreet Music foretold the manner by which Eno would realize self-contained musical environments, On Land presages the sound of several musical elements acting independently, coinciding only by chance yet remaining cohesive. The tracks of On Land, all fairly unchanging environments in this way, seem to similarly extend infinitely past the boundaries of their beginnings and ends.\r\n> Eno has talked of finding his inspiration for On Land in Ghana, when he used a microphone and headphones to hear the conflated sounds of his surrounding radius. \"The effect of this simple technological system was to cluster all the disparate sounds into one aural frame; they became music.\" (For a demonstration of this effect, just walk around outside with a microphone amplified into a pair of headphones: It really is striking to hear the world flattened into two dimensions upon one's ears.) The result was an attempt to make dense \"worlds\" of sound using the same sense of disparate yet spatially connected elements. The album is both more varied than his other ambient works and more foreboding. The atmospheres in many of On Land's pieces are so dense as to leave one staring down a chasm of sound, with no visible bottom apparent. Eno used several nonmusical objects and field recordings to contribute to On Land's thick aural web, the album being a testament to Eno's use of the studio as an instrument. On Land intensifies the most subtle and indescribable of emotions, and it stands at the forefront of the transformative possibilities inherent in non-rhythmic, non-melodic music.","meta":"6e42150df573e075ac5cb795986b1e1e","hash":"40fb50889aaeb0885c2c0342695d0490","time":"2014-07-10T03:52:59Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"music ambient eno"},

Writing and design almost always sorta work...even a first draft or an initial design communicates something to the reader\/viewer. When the code works within the specifications, it's done. The writing or design process is never done; even a great piece of writing or the best design can be improved incrementally or even scrapped altogether to go in a different and potentially more fruitful direction. Maybe, for me, programming's definite ending is what makes it so enjoyable. The flow state comes from knowing that, while the journey is difficult and maddening and messily creative (just as with writing or design), there's a definite point at which it's done and you can move on to the next challenge.","meta":"8342e6b45d8db58161827030281251d9","hash":"29eddedbfee711b4de8030453af57505","time":"2014-06-20T20:22:37Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"programming work"},

{"href":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monad_(functional_programming)","description":"Monad (functional programming)","extended":"> In functional programming, a monad is a structure that represents computations defined as sequences of steps. A type with a monad structure defines what it means to chain operations, or nest functions of that type together. This allows the programmer to build pipelines that process data in steps, in which each action is decorated with additional processing rules provided by the monad. As such, monads have been described as \"programmable semicolons\"; a semicolon is the operator used to chain together individual statements in many imperative programming languages, thus the expression implies that extra code will be executed between the statements in the pipeline. Monads have also been explained with a physical metaphor as assembly lines, where a conveyor belt transports data between functional units that transform it one step at a time. They can also be seen as a functional design pattern to build generic types.","meta":"64cc2ddca3dc88dd7705a1e88cc7e17d","hash":"be54b26dce958a62ce3c07eaf8f4af11","time":"2014-06-18T03:14:49Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"programming wikipedia functions"},

{"href":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_Unix","description":"History of Unix","extended":"> The history of Unix dates back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric were developing an experimental time sharing operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe. Multics introduced many innovations, but had many problems.\r\n> \r\n> Bell Labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims, slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, M. D. McIlroy, and J. F. Ossanna, decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. In 1979, Dennis Ritchie described their vision for Unix:\r\n> \r\n> What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.\r\n> \r\n> While Ken Thompson still had access to the Multics environment, he wrote simulations for the new file and paging system on it. He also programmed a game called Space Travel, but the game needed a more efficient and less expensive machine to run on, and eventually he found a little-used PDP-7 at Bell Labs. On this PDP-7, in 1969, a team of Bell Labs researchers led by Thompson and Ritchie, including Rudd Canaday, developed a hierarchical file system, the concepts of computer processes and device files, a command-line interpreter, and some small utility programs.","meta":"c675441b343e0500b247ad50f5371065","hash":"f833477d0e297bdd5f41fa682584125e","time":"2014-06-02T20:45:40Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"history computers unix os wikipedia cli"},

{"href":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm","description":"Dijkstra's algorithm","extended":"> Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956 and published in 1959, is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree. This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.\r\n> \r\n> For a given source vertex (node) in the graph, the algorithm finds the path with lowest cost (i.e. the shortest path) between that vertex and every other vertex. It can also be used for finding costs of shortest paths from a single vertex to a single destination vertex by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination vertex has been determined. For example, if the vertices of the graph represent cities and edge path costs represent driving distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities. As a result, the shortest path algorithm is widely used in network routing protocols, most notably IS-IS and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).\r\n>\r\n> Dijkstra's original algorithm does not use a min-priority queue and runs in time O(|V|^2) (where |V| is the number of vertices). The idea of this algorithm is also given in (Leyzorek et al. 1957). The implementation based on a min-priority queue implemented by a Fibonacci heap and running in O(|E|+|V|\\log|V|) (where |E| is the number of edges) is due to (Fredman & Tarjan 1984). This is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm for arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights.","meta":"f1e2826177b1bc8d6c2413e171dbb3a7","hash":"39f3b9bb84a491f6ec044a8640febbaa","time":"2014-06-02T02:54:19Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"algorithm computers programming"},

In fact, Darwin's On the Origin of Species evolved over the course of several editions he wrote, edited, and updated during his lifetime. The first English edition was approximately 150,000 words and the sixth is a much larger 190,000 words. In the changes are refinements and shifts in ideas \u2014 whether increasing the weight of a statement, adding details, or even a change in the idea itself.\r\n> The second edition, for instance, adds a notable \u201cby the Creator\u201d to the closing paragraph, giving greater attribution to a higher power. In another example, the phrase \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d \u2014 usually considered central to the theory and often attributed to Darwin \u2014 instead came from British philosopher Herbert Spencer, and didn't appear until the fifth edition of the text. Using the six editions as a guide, we can see the unfolding and clarification of Darwin's ideas as he sought to further develop his theory during his lifetime.","meta":"e68029cbfc45e06188324145e1298150","hash":"c214319fd9d372bfae5d6096c4a0de22","time":"2014-05-22T16:26:22Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"history evolution science visualization text literature"},

And, yes, bone-in. Schmuck. Take the steak home. Get a bigass frying pan and put the shit on the stove, cranking the heat up as far as that fucker will go. Take a shitload of salt\u2014rocksalt, you dumb motherfucker, none of that fine-grained crap here\u2014and toss it around the bottom of the pan. When the pan is hot as all fuck\u2014it should scorch the shit out of your finger if you're stupid enough to touch it\u2014put the fucking steak on there. You can crack some pepper on the top of the steak as the bottom is searing, but don't even talk to me about garlic or onion powder or COMPOUND FUCKING BUTTER, asshole. This is steak, all you fucking need is salt and pepper. After a bit (3 minutes for pink, 5 for cooked good), flip that shit over and do the same fucking thing you just did with the other side, i.e. sit on your ass and wait for your motherfucking steak to be ready, you useless assbag. When you're done, sling that shit on a plate. Beringer's 1996 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley Private Reserve makes an absolutely delightful accompaniment, particularly if you've taken care to let it breathe a bit before quaffing. Also, make some fucking potatoes, because that's what you eat with a fucking steak.

{"href":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Colors_of_noise","description":"Colors of noise","extended":"> In audio engineering, electronics, physics, and many other fields, the color of a noise signal (a signal produced by a stochastic process) is generally understood to be some broad characteristic of its power spectrum.\r\n> \r\n> Different \"colors\" of noise have significantly different properties: for example, as audio signals they will sound differently to human ears, and as images they will have a visibly different texture. Therefore, each application typically requires noise of a specific \"color\".\r\n> \r\n> This sense of \"color\" for noise signals is similar to the concept of timbre in music (which is also called \"tone color\"); however the latter is almost always used for sound, and may consider very detailed features of the spectrum.\r\n> \r\n> The practice of naming kinds of noise after colors started with \"white noise\", a signal whose spectrum has equal power within any equal interval of frequencies. That name was given by analogy with \"white light\", which was (incorrectly) assumed to have such a \"flat\" power spectrum over the visible range. Other color names, like \"pink\", \"red\", and \"blue\" were then given to noise with other spectral profiles; often (but not always) in reference to the color of light with similar spectra. Some of those names have standard definitions in certain disciplines, while others are very informal and poorly defined.","meta":"70a211ce371f7a3c0ccdd66fa7d44afb","hash":"dc4c854525d560746e1cecda180e4268","time":"2014-05-09T18:38:54Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"wikipedia noise sound"},

In 2010, it was designed and made into a scale model by Julijonas Urbonas, a PhD candidate at the Royal College of Art in London. Urbonas, who has worked at an amusement park, stated that the goal of his concept roller coaster is to take lives \"with elegance and euphoria\". As for practical applications of his design, Urbonas mentioned \"euthanasia\" or \"execution\". John Allen, who served as president of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, inspired Urbonas with his description of the \"ultimate\" roller coaster as one that \"sends out 24 people and they all come back dead\". As it would euthanise its passengers, it was criticised by the anti-euthanasia association Care Not Killing.","meta":"8bb66e52306ad7474a59e2bc1edb2368","hash":"c24a9486bccfd2310d772d917e08ae4b","time":"2014-05-08T17:55:39Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"death physics wikipedia wtf"},

Cryptography is often used to replace or in combination with steganography. In the past, cryptography helped ensure secrecy in important communications, such as those of spies, military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field of cryptography has expanded its remit in two ways. Firstly, it provides mechanisms for more than just keeping secrets: schemes like digital signatures and digital cash, for example. Secondly, cryptography has come to be in widespread use by many civilians who do not have extraordinary needs for secrecy, although typically it is transparently built into the infrastructure for computing and telecommunications, and users are not aware of it.\r\n","meta":"48b8ba6cdbabef88ef089764811ff5e5","hash":"d69d4a781d4973fe32f8fb593e59678b","time":"2014-04-30T15:30:21Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"wikipedia cryptography technology archives information"},

The independence movement (rather than statehood) is instead known as Cascadia.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Jefferson\" has also been used for other proposed states: the name was proposed in the 19th century for Jefferson Territory (roughly modern Colorado), as well as in 1915 in a bill in the Texas legislature for a proposed state that would be created from the Texas Panhandle region.","meta":"8ceaaa7391ace7531f489e8aa54d0ad7","hash":"5066afb152818c713778f0cb2fde08ce","time":"2014-04-29T21:06:06Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"california oregon usa america wikipedia west"},

The label was purchased by BMG through a series of buyouts from 1992 through 1996 and is currently a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment after BMG's subsequent merger in 2008. Private Music, also a subsidiary of BMG, has issued some back-catalog releases under the Windham Hill Records imprint. Since the Sony merger, Windham Hill currently releases no new material but recycles albums and compilations as part of Sony's Legacy Recordings brand.","meta":"2364753737801700204c4df36809d733","hash":"458a02b95891b7ed919a99632cd25732","time":"2014-04-14T17:42:41Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"records music label wikipedia ambient newage"},

{"href":"http:\/\/longform.org\/stories\/stickeen-john-muir","description":"Longform Reprints: Stickeen: The Story of a Dog by John Muir","extended":"> He knew very well what I meant, and at last, with the courage of despair, hushed and breathless, he crouched down on the brink in the hollow I had made for my knees, pressed his body against the ice as if trying to get the advantage of the friction of every hair, gazed into the first step, put his little feet together and slid them slowly, slowly over the edge and down into it, bunching all four in it and almost standing on his head. Then, without lifting his feet, as well as I could see through the snow, he slowly worked them over the edge of the step and down into the next and the next in succession in the same way, and gained the end of the bridge. Then, lifting his feet with the regularity and slowness of the vibrations of a seconds pendulum, as if counting and measuring one-two-three , holding himself steady against the gusty wind, and giving separate attention to each little step, he gained the foot of the cliff, while I was on my knees leaning over to give him a lift should he succeed in getting within reach of my arm. Here he halted in dead silence, and it was here I feared he might fail, for dogs are poor climbers. I had no cord. If I had had one, I would have dropped a noose over his head and hauled him up. But while I was thinking whether an available cord might be made out of clothing, he was looking keenly into the series of notched steps and finger-holds I had made, as if counting them, and fixing the position of each one of them in his mind. Then suddenly up he came in a springy rush, hooking his paws into the steps and notches so quickly that I could not see how it was done, and whizzed past my head, safe at last!\r\n>\r\n> And now came a scene! \"Well done, well done, little boy! Brave boy!\" I cried, trying to catch and caress him; but he would not be caught. Never before or since have I seen anything like so passionate a revulsion from the depths of despair to exultant, triumphant, uncontrollable joy. He flashed and darted hither and thither as if fairly demented, screaming and shouting, swirling round and round in giddy loops and circles like a leaf in a whirlwind, lying down, and rolling over and over, sidewise and heels over head, and pouring forth a tumultuous flood of hysterical cries and sobs and gasping mutterings. When I ran up to him to shake him, fearing he might die of joy, he flashed off two or three hundred yards, his feet in a mist of motion; then, turning suddenly, came back in a wild rush and launched himself at my face, almost knocking me down. all the while screeching and screaming and shouting as if saying, \"Saved! saved! saved!\" Then away again, dropping suddenly at times with his feet in the air, trembling and fairly sobbing. Such passionate emotion was enough to kill him. Moses' stately song of triumph after escaping the Egyptians and the Red Sea was nothing to it. Who could have guessed the capacity of the dull, enduring little fellow for all that most stirs this mortal frame? Nobody could have helped crying with him!\r\n>\r\n> But there is nothing like work for toning down excessive fear or joy. So I ran ahead, calling him in as gruff a voice as I could command to come on and stop his nonsense, for we had far to go and it would soon he dark. Neither of us feared another trial like this. Heaven would surely count one enough for a lifetime. The ice ahead was gashed by thousands of crevasses, but they were common ones. The joy of deliverance burned in us like fire, and we ran without fatigue, every muscle with immense rebound glorying in its strength. Stickeen flew across everything in his way, and not till dark did he settle into his normal fox-like trot. At last the cloudy mountains came in sight, and we soon felt the solid rock beneath our feet, and were safe. Then came weakness. Danger had vanished, and so had our strength. We tottered down the lateral moraine in the dark, over boulders and tree trunks, through the bushes and devil-club thickets of the grove where we had sheltered ourselves in the morning, and across the level mudslope of the terminal moraine. We reached camp about ten o'clock, and found a big fire and a big supper. A party of Hoona Indians had visited Mr. Young, bringing a gift of porpoise meat and wild strawberries, and Hunter Joe had brought in a wild goat. But we lay down, too tired to eat much, and soon fell into a troubled sleep. The man who said, \"The harder the toil, the sweeter the rest,\" never was profoundly tired. Stickeen kept springing up and muttering in his sleep, no doubt dreaming that he was still on the brink of the crevasse; and so did I, that night and many others long afterward, when I was over-tired.\r\n>\r\n> Thereafter Stickeen was a changed dog. During the rest of the trip, instead of holding aloof, he always lay by my side, tried to keep me constantly in sight, and would hardly accept a morsel of food, however tempting, from any hand but mine. At night, when all was quiet about the camp-fire, he would come to me and rest his head on my knee with a look of devotion as if I were his god. And often as he caught my eye he seemed to be trying to say, \"Wasn't that an awful time we had together on the glacier?\"","meta":"46f4faf46f3b562adb5a0755fafa0067","hash":"086846f0b781a34a8121c9e86870cfc2","time":"2014-03-31T15:10:01Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"nature dogs mountains adventure alaska"},

{"href":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/TopoJSON","description":"TopoJSON","extended":"TopoJSON is a file format, console script, and a client side JavaScript library to store and process GIS data with geospatial topology. A major improvement over GeoJSON is that TopoJSON files collects lines as arcs made of sequences of points, and then defines both complex polylines and polygons as sequences of previously defined arcs. Shapes are sequences of arcs, arcs are sequences of points. Each arc is defined once and only once, but could be called several times, thus reducing redundancy, decreasing the file size, easing edits of neighbor shapes in an unified edit on the common arc(s) thus avoiding artifacts apparitions. The client side JavaScript library converts TopoJSON files into GeoJSON which allows other systems such D3.js to use this GIS data and generate SVG graphisms. The console script allows the conversion of GIS files (shapefiles, GeoJSON, etc.) into lighter TopoJSON files, as well as various basic processing such simplification, merge, conserve selected properties, append external data, etc.","meta":"7be5fe165c02164793fff997b5ab7802","hash":"970269fbf9e0ddf88de586833c828981","time":"2014-03-23T01:06:28Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"javascript json maps data"},

The vehicles are NASA designed robotic landers that will be able to land and takeoff with 1,100 pounds (500 kg) of cargo on the Moon.

This recipe maintains that spirit, but is much faster,\r\n> easier, less expensive, and more contemporary, emphasizing the\r\n> beans and vegetables over meat. (That probably makes it more,\r\n> not less, traditional, since meat was always hard to come by before\r\n> the mid-20th century.)\r\n\r\n> Ingredients\r\n\r\n> 2 tablespoons olive oil\r\n> 1 pound Italian sausages, bone-in pork chops, confit duck legs, or duck breasts, or a combination\r\n> 1 tablespoon chopped garlic\r\n> 2 leeks or onions, trimmed, washed, and sliced\r\n> 2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch lengths\r\n> 3 celery stalks, cut into 1\/2-inch pieces\r\n> 2 medium zucchinis or 1 small head green cabbage, cut into 1\/2-inch pieces\r\n> Salt and freshly ground black pepper\r\n> 4 cups chopped tomatoes, with their juice (canned are fine)\r\n> 1\/4 cup fresh chopped parsley leaves\r\n> 1 tablespoon fresh chopped thyme leaves\r\n> 2 bay leaves\r\n> 4 cups cooked white beans (canned are OK), drained and liquid reserved in any case\r\n> 2 cups stock, dry red wine, bean cooking liquid, or water, plus more as needed\r\n> 1\/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste\r\n\r\n> Method\r\n\r\n> 1. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add the meat, and cook, turning as needed, until the meat is deeply browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.

Turn the heat to medium and add the garlic, leeks or onions, carrots, celery, and zucchini or cabbage; and sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, their liquid, the reserved meat, and the herbs and bring to a boil. Add the beans; bring to a boil again, stirring occasionally, then reduce the heat so the mixture bubbles gently but continuously. Cook for about 20 minutes, adding the liquid when the mixture gets thick and the vegetables are melting away.\r\n> 3. Fish out the meat and remove the bones and skin as needed. Chop into chunks and return to the pot along with the cayenne. Cook another minute or two to warm through, then taste and adjust seasoning if necessary and serve.","meta":"f2fbdf522fe842b01525b0adb90a1bdd","hash":"fca6e61392cb60501da0abdf637cf17a","time":"2014-02-19T14:22:41Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"recipes soup food nytimes winter"},

{"href":"http:\/\/93.184.66.227\/","description":"This is a Tor Exit Router","extended":"Most likely you are accessing this website because you had some issue with the traffic coming from this IP. This router is part of the Tor Anonymity Network, which is dedicated to providing privacy to people who need it most: average computer users. This router IP should be generating no other traffic, unless it has been compromised.\r\n\r\nTor sees use by many important segments of the population, including whistle blowers, journalists, Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall and oppressive censorship, abuse victims, stalker targets, the US military, and law enforcement, just to name a few. While Tor is not designed for malicious computer users, it is true that they can use the network for malicious ends. In reality however, the actual amount of abuse is quite low. This is largely because criminals and hackers have significantly better access to privacy and anonymity than do the regular users whom they prey upon. Criminals can and do build, sell, and trade far larger and more powerful networks than Tor on a daily basis. Thus, in the mind of this operator, the social need for easily accessible censorship-resistant private, anonymous communication trumps the risk of unskilled bad actors, who are almost always more easily uncovered by traditional police work than by extensive monitoring and surveillance anyway.\r\n\r\nIn terms of applicable law, the best way to understand Tor is to consider it a network of routers operating as common carriers, much like the Internet backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Tor routers explicitly do not contain identifiable routing information about the source of a packet, and no single Tor node can determine both the origin and destination of a given transmission.\r\n\r\nAs such, there is little the operator of this router can do to help you track the connection further. This router maintains no logs of any of the Tor traffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or illegitimate traffic (or to filter one from the other). Attempts to seize this router will accomplish nothing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this machine also serves as a carrier of email, which means that its contents are further protected under the ECPA. 18 USC 2707 explicitly allows for civil remedies ($1000\/account plus legal fees) in the event of a seizure executed without good faith or probable cause (it should be clear at this point that traffic with an originating IP address of 93.184.66.227 should not constitute probable cause to seize the machine). Similar considerations exist for 1st amendment content on this machine.\r\n\r\nIf you are a representative of a company who feels that this router is being used to violate the DMCA, please be aware that this machine does not host or contain any illegal content. Also be aware that network infrastructure maintainers are not liable for the type of content that passes over their equipment, in accordance with DMCA \"safe harbor\" provisions. In other words, you will have just as much luck sending a takedown notice to the Internet backbone providers. Please consult EFF's prepared response for more information on this matter.","meta":"930ac6a50a7f622d5fb1ab8636518535","hash":"146b698b32b7fcf7a08fd92f1c1a8473","time":"2014-02-16T18:50:53Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"tor privacy internet security networks"},

{"href":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Planetary_Unfolding","description":"Planetary Unfolding","extended":"> Michael Stearns became a resident composer musician at Emily Conrad's meditation classes in 1975. He composed and performed at first on a Minimoog and various electro-acoustic instruments. In 1979, he was introduced to the Serge modular synthesizer by Kevin Braheny, who owned a 15-panels system (dubbed \"The Mighty Serge\"), which he used on Morning Jewel. He then built his own 12-panels Serge. On this one, as he already did with Braheny's system, he performed electronic music with a strong feeling of space.\r\n> Planetary Unfolding was recorded around 1981, when Michael left Conrad's Continuum Studio. Musical ideas that Michael performed on the Serge the previous years were put together and developed and gave birth to this 52 minute piece of music, with two parts each cut in three tracks.\r\n> The album was given a first release under Michael Stearns' own label, Continuum Montage, in 1981. It was reissued on CD from 1985 to 1991 by Sonic Atmospheres and is since unavailable: as of June 2009, it hasn't been reissued on Stearns's 2000-launched label Earth Turtle.","meta":"db670c15cf65ee16b541e234a29a7cb3","hash":"4e487ec81d19199400f447cfded69041","time":"2014-02-09T19:00:17Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"music wikipedia ambient synths records"},

What bands that I don't really care about will be named the \"headliners\"? What bands that I mildly like will be in much smaller type, in a strange order, that makes no sense based on either record sales or fan base or any other metric. Ooh, I'll think, finally, a festival where I can see both Mogwai and Girl Talk and Laura Mvula and maybe a flashback performance of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion! Sure, I'd totally love to see a set by The Magician. And Laurent Garnier! God I used to love Laurent Garnier. Also upon Googling, some of these other bands sound kind of okay.\r\n> \r\n> But once again, this year, like every year that has come before, I'm definitely not going to Coachella. Seems really far.

Instead of trying to plan out everything we wanted to measure and putting it in a classical configuration management system, we decided to make it ridiculously simple for any engineer to get anything they can count or time into a graph with almost no effort. (And, because we can push code anytime, anywhere, it\u2019s easy to deploy the code too, so we can go from \u201chow often does X happen?\u201d to a graph of X happening in about half an hour, if we want to.)","meta":"61e3fd681b8c556c84d5db9104b5f99b","hash":"03fc1ef815b2f8df7b9f70b5dddfb815","time":"2014-01-09T06:57:31Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"data programming nodejs infrastructure"},

{"href":"http:\/\/ursulakleguin.com\/FAQ_Questionnaire5_01.html#EkumenBooks","description":"Ursula Le Guin - FAQ","extended":"> People write me nice letters asking what order they ought to read my science fiction books in \u2014 the ones that are called the Hainish or Ekumen cycle or saga or something. The thing is, they aren't a cycle or a saga. They do not form a coherent history. There are some clear connections among them, yes, but also some extremely murky ones. And some great discontinuities (like, what happened to \"mindspeech\" after Left Hand of Darkness? Who knows? Ask God, and she may tell you she didn't believe in it any more.)\r\n> OK, so, very roughly, then:\r\n> Rocannon's World, Planet of Exile, City of Illusions: where they fit in the \"Hainish cycle\" is anybody's guess, but I'd read them first because they were written first. In them there is a \"League of Worlds,\" but the Ekumen does not yet exist.\r\n> Then you could read The Word for World is Forest, The Left Hand of Darkness, The Dispossessed, in any order. In Dispossessed, the ansible gets invented; but they're using it in Left Hand, which was written fifteen years earlier. Please do not try to explain this to me. I will not understand.\r\n> Then in the collection of stories A Fisherman of the Inland Sea, the three last stories are Ekumenical, and we even finally find out a little about Hain, where it all began. The story suite Four Ways to Forgiveness is part of that universe, and so is the novel The Telling. But I have to warn you that the planet Werel in Four Ways is not the planet Werel in Planet of Exile. In between novels, I forget planets. Sorry.\r\n> The Eye of the Heron may or may not be set in the Hainish universe; it really doesn't matter. As for The Lathe of Heaven and Always Coming Home, my Terran science fiction novels, they definitely don't exist in the same universe as the Hainish or Ekumenical books.\r\n> While we're at it, Earthsea really does go in order, because it is all one story: A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan, The Farthest Shore, Tehanu, Tales from Earthsea, The Other Wind. (My British publisher insisted on doing the two last in the wrong order, and I'm very sorry about that, since \"Dragonfly\" in the Tales makes the bridge between Tehanu and The Other Wind.)\r\n> Catwings goes: Catwings, Catwings Return, Wonderful Alexander, and Jane On Her Own. (Since the publisher, Scholastic, seems to have some deep metaphysical objection to ever letting anybody sell the four books in the same place at the same time, go for the four-volume set \u2014 if you can find it.)","meta":"bcfde03a079d4ec0a079367e73305354","hash":"016423113165808610f4f1a4844997d3","time":"2013-12-22T03:01:55Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"books scifi"},

Image Credit: NASA\/DOE\/Fermi LAT Collaboration \nWe know a fair bit about black holes , those dense remnants of dead stars that lie in the centre of galaxies whose gravitational pull is so strong that even light can\u2019t escape them. But for all we know, astronomers have never recorded one\u2019s creation; scientists typically study the after effects of this cosmic process. Until now. It turns out that a bright flash observed on April 27 of this year was actually a black hole forming. Called GRB 130427A, it\u2019s already being touted as a watershed moment for astronomy. \n\nIt might sound counterintuitive, but a star\u2019s death is actually a dramatic and energetic event. As a star ages, the core that has provided its life-force for millions or billions of years runs out of fuel. This causes the star to collapse, and the act of imploding triggers a shockwave that blows up the star's outer layer. This is the bright supernova astronomers on Earth have seen from time to time for centuries. At the same time, the dying star shoots out a powerful blast of gamma-ray radiation.\n\nWhile the star shoots out light and gamma-rays, its core shrinks and becomes steadily more dense. The increase in density has the effect of increasing the star\u2019s core\u2019s gravity to the point that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The border around that new black hole where the escape velocity is faster than the speed of light is called the event horizon. Whatever happens beyond that border we\u2019ll never know. \n\nThe recent observation is the first time a star's death and a black hole's birth has ever been recorded . Never before have a gamma-ray burst and its associated supernova explosion been measured simultaneously. This confluence of observations is unprecedented, and it comes thanks to a barrage of orbiting satellites working in tandem with ground based telescopes. \n\nThis illustration of a gamma-ray burst shows a dying star forming a black hole, which drives a particle jet into space. Image Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center \nNASA\u2019s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and Swift Gamma-ray Burst Mission were the first to detect the gamma-ray burst. They sent out an alert to observatories on the ground, including where to look (the constellation Leo). The Rapid Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) Project telescopes in Los Alamos, New Mexico, were quick to respond. These telescopes, which scan the sky for optical events like flashes from distant stars, are also designed to react quickly to capture astronomical phenomena as they happen. They quickly honed in on the blast and imaged the optical light, an event so bright (a magnitude 7 event on the astronomical brightness scale) that it could have been seen through simple binoculars. This optical measurement was complemented by the gamma-ray information gathered by Fermi and Swift, as well as x-ray data gathered by NASA\u2019s NuSTAR mission.\n\nThe blast was more powerful than anything astronomers have ever seen. Right as the optical blast peaked, Fermi\u2019s Large Area Telescope detected the largest spike in GeV gamma-rays ever recorded in association with an astronomical event like this \u2014 so big, astronomers thought it was theoretically impossible. As the gamma-ray burst subsided, so too did the optical light, leaving behind an afterglow akin to the embers of a dying fire. It\u2019s another feature of these cosmic events astronomers have never before witnessed.\n\nIt\u2019s the array of data types \u2014 optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray information \u2014 that has scientists so excited. Though astronomers have yet to really dig into the data, preliminary results are already challenging assumptions about the universe. Like the sheer brightness of the blast, for example. That GRB 130427A was so much brighter and more powerful than what astronomers thought was possible is forcing scientists to rethink existing theories of radiation to allow for these kinds of events. It\u2019s also challenging the long-held theory that the light from supernovas come exclusively from an internal shockwave. GRB 130427A suggests that there might be an external shockwave at play, too. \n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say just how much this new data is going to change how we look at and understand the universe, but this is likely not the last we\u2019ll hear about GRB 130427A.","meta":"c40c63d06a4465f1315c96d1f616dabf","hash":"be99bb290b59bb5999eed0a7e631e14e","time":"2013-11-29T14:44:12Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""},

It\u2019s sad that there\u2019s no plain text backend for Twitter, Foursquare and everything else I use. It\u2019s annoying that Aperture owns all of my photos, and there\u2019s no IMAP-like protocol for keeping my photos in the cloud forever, being able to hop between applications and code my own custom views and actions against an API.\r\n> \r\n> I cut my teeth on the open web of the early 2000s. It was APIs, and mashups. Mac OS X turned my laptop into a web server and coding machine, just the same as where I hosted the toys and tools that I wrote. This is what the future was going to be like.\r\n> \r\n> And then it didn\u2019t happen. Code is fragile because APIs keep changing and nobody cares about scripting anymore.

I\u2019m not doing much about it (except that architecturally BERG Cloud is going to great lengths to avoid lock-in, and uses web APIs for integration), and ease of use trumps everything.

I\u2019d like a camera that has Dropbox built-in. And I\u2019d like to write code that deals with both of these. I\u2019m not very good at writing code so it had better be easy.\r\n> \r\n> So is that okay? My dream setup is an alternate global technical paradigm?

Aside from the novel flair of sleeping in a little and indulging in a larger-than-usual brunch, Sundays generally signify the slow death march towards the work week. This past summer, however, Sundays were different. At the behest of a friend and dance music enthusiast, he suggested a weekend pastime we'd been failing to participate in. From then on, a small army of us trekked out to Gowanus Grove on Sunday afternoons to go to Mister Sunday, the weekly party hosted by Eamon Harkin and Justin Carter.\n\nMister Sunday is only one of a few things keeping Harkin and Carter busy these days. In fact, their Sunday parties are a recent addition to the pair's dance-centric endeavors. In 2008, Harkin and Carter began throwing loft parties in Brooklyn under the Mister Saturday Night moniker. The outdoor daytime parties followed a year later. In addition to over 100 parties with guest spots from the likes of Theo Parrish, Ben UFO, Four Tet, and Moodymann, Mister Saturday Night is also a successful (and continuously growing) label, having released music by Anthony Naples, Archie Pelago, and most recently, Lumigraph. I chatted with one half of Mister Saturday Night to talk about the duo's history, cultivating a positive dance floor, and the challenges of New York real estate.\n\nAH: You came to New York from Ireland about ten years ago. How did you get your foot in the door? \n\nEH: I came here and I didn\u2019t know anybody. I had been DJing and throwing small parties in London. When I came here, my way of just being social and finding friends was to launch myself into going to parties. Musically my background at that point was more aligned with guitar music and less so of club music or electronic music. So I initially started going to parties that were more centered towards new wave and rock and roll and punk. There was quite a big scene at that time for that type of music. It was centered around a bunch of parties which were called Motherfucker .

The program dates back to 1998, and the infected networks are referred to internally as \"sleeper cells\" that can be switched on or off at will. Cyber operations are increasingly important for the NSA. Computer hacks are relatively inexpensive and provide the NSA with opportunities to obtain information that they otherwise would not have access to.

Add butter and pulse until the mixture forms chickpea-size pieces. Add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse until the dough just comes together. It should be moist, but not wet. On a lightly floured surface, gather the dough into a ball. Flatten into a disk with the heel of your hand. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.\r\n> On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to a 12-inch circle. Transfer crust to a 9-inch pie plate. Fold over any excess dough, then crimp edges. Prick crust all over with a fork. Chill crust for 30 minutes.\r\n> While the dough chills, heat oven to 375 degrees. Line chilled crust with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 20 minutes; remove foil and weights and bake until pale golden, 5 to 7 minutes more. Cool on rack until needed.\r\n> Lower oven temperature to 325 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin pur\u00e9e, eggs, cream, dark brown sugar, brandy, ginger, cinnamon, 1\/2 teaspoon salt, the nutmeg and clove. Pour mixture into the cooled pie shell. Transfer pie to a large baking sheet. Bake until crust is golden and center jiggles just slightly when shaken, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool completely before serving.\r\n> \r\n> Note: To make butternut squash pur\u00e9e, peel, halve and seed a 2 1\/2- to 3-pound squash and cut flesh into 1 1\/2-inch chunks. Coat with melted butter or oil and roast at 400 degrees, stirring once or twice, until the squash is tender, about 30 to 45 minutes. Let cool, then pur\u00e9e in a food processor.","meta":"95352de606274738f9d4c94be437d614","hash":"89511b013e2d52aede90442c92ffb2f9","time":"2013-11-16T19:03:53Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"pie recipes food thanksgiving dessert"},

It draws you in. You could believe in it more... Everyone goes on about themselves, they reveal everything and give it away...They should just hold back a bit, it's sexier.\" \n\n- Burial, in a 2012 interview with The Wire \n\nMost genres of music have, at one time or another, been accused of sexism, of creating spaces where women felt either unwelcome or uncomfortable participating. The riot grrrl movement was all about bringing the girls out from hiding in the world of punk, encouraging them to make the leap from holding their boyfriend\u2019s coat to holding the mic. The realm of electronic music is arguably lagging behind the rock world in terms of addressing gender politics, and even in today\u2019s supposedly post-feminist climate, dance music can seem like an alienating place for a woman. Maybe this is because producing requires the sort of technological expertise that has often been gendered in our society as male.\n\nOr perhaps it has to do with the cold anonymity of the DJ\/producer figure, seemingly antithetical to female identity, which is invariably tied up with possessing an image and a clear-cut sexuality. The typical female pop star is marketed to be either sweet and innocent or wild and slutty-- and when she jumps from one side to the other, people experience the shift as appalling . Debates over how much skin woman can reveal, over the rigid rules of what is classy and what is trashy, have been going on for a long time, but the fighting over these rules seems only to legitimize their validity in the first place. In electronic music, which has traditionally been less centered on an artist's physical presence, the listener can't make snap judgments about the woman involved, and thus has to acknowledge her complexity. But despite these challenges, females in electronic music do exist. Earlier this year, Grimes described some of the conflicts surrounding being a female who also makes music in a Tumblr post , pointing out the way women in the music industry are routinely characterized by the same rigid virgin\/whore binary that permeates the rest of mainstream society. \"I don't want to be infantalized because I refuse to be sexualized,\" she writes in the second line of the piece. Female producers, like other female musicians, have struggled to achieve the same recognition that their male counterparts do, to be seen and heard apart from the way they look.\n\nRead More","meta":"dcbce1b2743fe60df6b6d7de690940f8","hash":"6f5596b9ccaf5d634c4120246be4f362","time":"2013-11-04T21:10:35Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""},

The worst part about our headlong trudge to the tomb is the way that once we realize how much road is already behind us it is far too late to go back and fix the mistakes we made along the way. Maybe the best bit about life\u2014and I am setting an admittedly low bar here, but look what we have to deal with\u2014is that although we are always tempted to pinpoint specific instances where the decisions we made had irrevocable effects on our trajectory from that moment forward, if we are honest with ourselves we can admit that, for the most part, we were going to wind up exactly where we did no matter what. We are who we are and the choices we make are the results of those immutable traits that add up to the person who, for better or worse and usually worse, stares back at us in the mirror each morning with a mixture of pity and astonishment. If we could turn back time we would mostly make the same mistakes, maybe at different moments but always moving us in the same direction. You've fucked up your life through an accretion of small details, not by one or two enormous errors. It is pointless to pine for a do-over; you would just do it over badly. That is who you are and at some point you will have to make peace with it. That said, you do have a chance this weekend to go back in time and do things differently, but it happens at 2 AM Sunday morning and, if you are not sleeping through it, you will almost certainly be ensconced in a bad decision you won't be able to do anything to alter with the extra hour you get. That's the way life works. It's what happens when you're busy finding ways to fuck things up for yourself.

{"href":"http:\/\/www.theatlanticcities.com\/commute\/2013\/10\/new-york-city-subway-operators-photography-club\/7370\/","description":"The New York City Subway Operators' Photography Club","extended":"The news was grim: five people dead, hundreds injured, and five subway cars trashed in a pile of debris. It was August 1991, and a No. 4 train had just derailed under Union Square in New York City in one of the\u00a0deadliest mass transit accidents in the city's history. Subway operator Glenn Rowe had finished his\u00a0shift on the day of the accident, when his brother, a work train operator for the MTA, called to say he had to work the salvage shift at the wreck. Would Rowe like to come along?\n\nRowe grabbed his camera, fastened his work vest and hurried to the abandoned 18th Street Lexington Avenue station. When he arrived, he flashed his employment pass to supervisors at the scene and pushed his way through to a clear position on the nearby platform, where he took some of the first photographs ever taken of the wreck.\n\nUnion Square accident, 1991. Glenn Rowe. \n\nThe photos could have amounted to tawdry voyeurism. Instead, Rowe managed to capture the gravity and the ghostly commotion of New York\u2019s subway workers at the scene of a tragedy. After all, Rowe is a seasoned photographer: he belongs to a club of sorts of current and former transit workers who double as secret, eloquent photographers of the trains and systems they operate.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, they documented the grimy, graffiti-covered subways where vigilante Guardian Angels squared off against thugs. Today, they snap mint-new cars with automated messages and light-up signs. Taken together, their thousands of photographs are an homage to New York\u2019s subway system.\n\n\"Most people do it because they\u2019re enthusiasts,\" says Nick DiBari, a photographer and dispatcher for several MTA subway lines. \"They want to have a record of it for future generations. You work with the equipment, you start to get attached to it.\"\n\nNo one knows exactly how many transit photographers are out there, but at least 20 current and former subway operators, dispatchers and conductors showed up to the 13th Annual Mass Transit & Trolley Modeler's Convention , held at Rutgers University\u2019s Student Center in early October, to buy and sell their transit-related photographs and memorabilia.\n\nFranklin Avenue shuttle, 1975. Steve Zabel. \n\nArrayed on dozens of tables in two large halls of the student center were old bus, trolley, train and subway maps, miniature transit models, subway roll signs, slides, vintage tickets, expired MetroCards, bus change collector machines and reams upon reams of photos from all eras by dozens of photographers.\n\nMost of the photos had labels that detailed the date the shot was taken, the model of the subway car, the photographer, and often the car's serial number, the station, and an explanatory note.\n\nWhile many subway shots document trains as a matter of plain historical fact, some are extraordinary. In one 1982 photo, a graffiti-scarred behemoth pulls in to Brooklyn\u2019s Avenue H station over snowy tracks. In another photo taken during rush hour at a grimy Grand Central in 1981, a woman peers out the front window of a muscular model R-36 7 train, draped in shadow, the fenders and her hair brightly outlined chiaroscuro-like.\n\nAvenue H, 1982. Michael Piselli. \n\nMany of the shots hint at incredible narratives. During the World Series in New York in 2000, Rowe found out that Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton\u2014mayor and senator at the time\u2014were on the same 7 train headed for Shea Stadium. Rowe trailed the train, then used his employee pass to get into the Corona Park subway yards to shoot the rare Subway Series redbird that had just transported the politicians to Game 3.\n\nSome photos are taken from operators' cabins as they drive, which is technically against MTA rules. Subway operators have even been known to ask their dispatcher, who controls the light signals on the track, to halt their train while they run out of their trains to take the perfect shot.\n\nAt the transit convention, non-transit-employee hobbyists wandered among transit workers, and older retirees caught up with old friends from their MTA days. Carlton Bridges has been a subway operator since 1985, but coincidentally, he was Glenn Rowe\u2019s partner for a year before that, conducting the same A train Rowe was operating. Bridges's job as a conductor was to inform passengers which station they had arrived at. He joked around with Rowe beside his display table.\n\n\"I was the highest quality conductor,\" says Bridges. \"I spoke the Queen\u2019s English.\" He leans toward an iPhone like it's the microphone in a conductor's cabin. \"Station-stop is 59th street. 59th street. Yeah, that\u2019s the way I would say it. Station-stop. Because it was a station-stop, you know what I mean? Station-stop is 34th street. Station-stop is 34th.\"\n\nAt another table, Anthony Errante, a former subway operator, marveled at photos by Joe Saitta, an older photographer who recently died. \"That\u2019s in East New York,\" says Errante, pointing to a black and white photo of an elevated line with a steel girder hanging above the tracks. \"They were going to build an express track above it, but they never got to it.\"\n\nGrand Central, 1981. Steve Zabel. \n\nThere are a few names well-known in transit enthusiasts' circles to be among the most prolific photographers: Mike Piselli, Ed McKernan and Rowe, among others. But perhaps the most notorious subway photographer is the legendary Steve Zabel, a subway operator who was active in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThere are stories of Zabel halting his train, changing the cars' roll signs to display a different subway line, and then getting out and taking shots, much to the confusion of his passengers. Zabel used to lie down on the track bed or wait atop well-situated buildings above elevated lines to capture the most auspicious angles. Nearly everyone who collects has at least a few Zabels.\n\n\"Steve would climb halfway up a light pole to take a good shot. I\u2019ve got a lot of slides from his collection,\" says Rowe. \"He was a great photographer.\"\n\nThe subway operators who are still taking photos said their interest began in childhood and never disappeared. They reminisced about early trips in the operators\u2019 cabins with relatives, and watching the subways roll by on elevated lines outside their windows.\n\n\"The first word I learned was probably 'train,'\" Bridges says. \"When I see little kids watching me operating in the cabin, I know they\u2019re awed, just like I was awed.\"","meta":"5315ad5e2440c0866d9377f104247cd0","hash":"1bdd82694a657a3b28f96f1034a3233a","time":"2013-10-30T12:41:42Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""},

It connects Magadan and Yakutsk, Nizhny Bestyakh on the eastern bank of Lena River at Yakutsk, which itself lies on the western bank, as there is no bridge. A ferry operates during the short summer. The length of the original road via Tomtor is about 1,900 kilometers (1,200\u00a0mi). At Nizhny Bestyakh it connects to the Lena Highway, also designated M56. Locally, the road is known as Trassa (Russian: \u0422\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430 - \"The Route\"), or Kolymskaya trassa (Russian: \u041a\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430 - \"The Kolyma Route\"), since it is the only road in the area and therefore needs no special name to distinguish it from other roads. The bulk of the Kolyma Highway, the sections between Khandyga and Magadan, is often referred to as the Road of Bones.","meta":"492b3ce3c2e22939861374a0f0013ae8","hash":"120491733df849f2f3d9908a861edf45","time":"2013-10-29T14:45:32Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"russia roads motorcycles trips siberia"},

{"href":"http:\/\/remysharp.com\/2013\/10\/22\/a-self-destructive-web\/","description":"A self destructive web","extended":"I\u2019m finding myself more and more nowadays interested in content that self destructs , or rather: expires after time and will no longer exist.\n\nThis post is more me dropping my thoughts on a page rather than having fully explored the idea (yet). Please note this post is also unedited (which I may use to my advantage and edit over time\u2026we\u2019ll see).\n\nSaving is \u201cforever\u201d? \nFrom an early age I\u2019ve played and worked with computers. I always understood that I was creating programs that would be saved .\n\nThat simple idea of saving, be it to a physical tape (I was a Spectrum user) or fast forward to the 90s when I published my first web pages \u2013 it was simply naughts and ones and since it was stored digitally\u2020, it could be copied over and over. When it was on a server, all it needed is the server to stay plugged in or even cached on another server and boom, you\u2019ve just unlocked forever .\n\n\u2020 Sure, the tape drive wasn\u2019t digital, but you\u2019ll forgive me. \n\nBut the simple fact is: we have to make an effort to preserve. Server drives crash, data gets lost, companies disappear (my first site was on lineone.net if anyone remember that \u2013 now long gone), domains expire and people die.\n\nSo what is forever ? Maybe there\u2019s an unspoken expiry? But when the expiry is in decades I feel like I conflate this with forever. I don\u2019t feel like the web community has been going long enough to see that long expiry showing it\u2019s face. Maybe we\u2019ve got another 20-30 years to go.\n\nShould it last forever? \nI was just looking at Stef Lewandowski\u2019s tweet about their new hack Linkydin . A nice idea, but I was asking myself: surely these links have context in time .\n\nIf you\u2019re sharing a group of links in a team, should that information expire? What good is it a year (or more) later to new team members, and in fact could it share old and busted knowledge that\u2019s been superceeded by better information? I don\u2019t know .\n\nThen I read Paul Neave\u2019s post \u201cWhy I create for the web\u201d and he boils it down to the humble hyperlink. Except the way I found his post was through a tweet. A tweet that a) I will unlikely find again (because twitter\u2019s archive search is limited) and b) goes through twitter\u2019s own link shortening service. If that service is shut down, then that hyperlink is sent to the grave (note that this isn\u2019t the point of @neave\u2019s post \u2013 but it got me thinking).\n\nI recently looked at Snapchat. Content that purposely destroys itself, I can only assume, because it\u2019s relevant for that moment \u2020. I also remember someone having a blog that would slowly remove all the blog posts one at a time over a period of time (and it would look like the articles were fading out at the bottom of the site).\n\n\u2020 Though Snapchat might not destroy the data on the phone it is actually removed from their server, which, to me, means it\u2019ll expire from existence somehow eventually. \n\nI like these later two because they\u2019ve thought specifically about time and how it should be addressed. My own blog, I haven\u2019t thought about time. I haven\u2019t thought about whether it\u2019ll shutdown after I die. I\u2019ve long stopped posting to jQuery for Designers but I\u2019ll keep the domain renewed\u2026but for how long? \n\nShould sites be retired to the archive.org? \n\nI don\u2019t know. A lot of these questions are why I\u2019ve asked Jeremy Keith to speak at Full Frontal whereby he chose the title \u201cTime\u201d. I expect he\u2019ll add a lot of clarity to some of my thoughts, but no doubt raise a good deal of new questions.\n\nEverything ends \nEverything has an expiry. Nothing lasts forever, but maybe my expectations need to adjust on the web. If something lasts a few years on the web that\u2019s a good thing. If I can get my data out of a web service, then that\u2019s a good thing too (because I\u2019m now responsible for my content, like photos which I care about).\n\nI\u2019m just very interested in seeing more services taking advantage of expiry as a feature. Heck, we buy and own (small) pets because the expiry is a feature! Why don\u2019t we use this more on the web?\n\nRelated posts: Firebug in IE for *any* web site Gravatar \u2013 bit of a bad start","meta":"32ff5d5c850e73cfd5186d0867e9b5e5","hash":"873486f5ffb6bff14f311ade1eada81f","time":"2013-10-22T12:39:55Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":""},

With the transformation of the Rijksmuseum over the past ten years, we had the opportunity to digitise the collection and realise a dream to make it available online to as wide an audience as possible. It can now be enjoyed by people across the world, and gives them the possibility of engaging with our extensive collection even if they do not have the ability to travel to Amsterdam. Rijks Studio also allows us to showcase works that might not be seen to the public otherwise. When the museum opens in April there will be 8,000 works of art and objects on view, but with Rijks Studio we can make many more works available online.","meta":"b6fa4f76090936cf2af883e2e5d90506","hash":"f949b52a3ae2c4777e963c69a55bd2f8","time":"2013-10-15T02:53:43Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"museums art internet archiving technology netherlands"},

I want to whisper in their ears: pull back for a second. Just for a moment. Stop and refine. Refine and refine.\r\n> \r\n> Refinement is hard because it requires faith. Faith in the thing you\u2019re refining \u2014 that the process of refinement will yield greater value; or faith that there is any value in the thing to begin with. To refine is some parts hubris, other parts humility, all parts vulnerability.\r\n> \r\n> If you release the unrefined thing into the world and it doesn\u2019t do well, you can always tell yourself: Ah, if only I had refined, it would have been great.\r\n> \r\n> To leave something important to you unrefined \u2014 uniterated, firstdrafted \u2014 is the laziest safety net you can deploy. It\u2019s almost lazier than not creating in the first place. It\u2019s also mean to those around you. Few things are meaner than foisting a lazy draft of a novel upon friends.\r\n> \r\n> Creation without refinement is a vicious loop. When the unrefined thing fails or falters, you tell yourself it isn\u2019t worth refining anymore. And so you move onto the next thing. You build something else. You draft and release another thing sans refinement. And so on, and so forth.\r\n> \r\n> To have faith in refinement, though, endows one with a certain private glory. There is a warmth found in the peeling back of rough onion layers to find that thing you felt but couldn\u2019t produce on first blush.\r\n> \r\n> In the process of refinement lies also meditations. A calm meditation like that found in sanding a hulking wooden table by hand, slowly, over the course of a week. Or it can be a restive meditation filled with resignation \u2014 resignation to the need to rebuild and remake and possibly start over.\r\n> \r\n> In refinement and iteration you finally get to know the thing you made. Really know it. Understand how bad it is. How great it could be. How much potential is still left unrealized. And within each iteration you move the thing forward; sometimes better, sometimes worse.\r\n> \r\n> But first you have to stop. If just for a moment.\r\n> \r\n> And so I keep whispering to all of them as I walk down the street: pull back and refine and refine.","meta":"6e2a3ad1aab218f244489d5983d66ed7","hash":"2b5c3eba1c369968dc06522ac817d9df","time":"2013-10-14T23:46:15Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"work programming life advice building"},

I want to make a developer environment for kids so that they can learn how to program on whatever device they have available, whether that be a Chromebook or their iPad or whatever computing device that has enough power. Most kids don\u2019t always get a full-on laptop, but they often have a powerful enough device. And these are all restricted consumer environments that are not really ideal for developing. So, Git is one big piece of this so that they can import and export code and collaborate with others on the internet, because I think learning how to do open source is a good part of learning to program, and you can learn how to work with others. Also, more than just JS Git, this app will have things like, on platforms that are supported, being able to UDP where it can auto-detect other instances of the app. So you could have a workshop full of kids with Chromebooks, and they can see each other\u2019s laptops without any configuration at all. They can just spawn local Git servers on their laptops and share with each other or spawn a local HTTP server and play each other\u2019s web apps or whatever that they want, and yeah, it\u2019s just a part of that. It\u2019s just a part that no one\u2019s really built the way I want and it takes a while. That\u2019s why I made such a big project out of it.","meta":"e5e3735447a697bc6be1f591d089a32e","hash":"c533c74fe398bcf1ed581e8e38ffc95d","time":"2013-10-11T13:43:46Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"javascript git programming education"},

Throughout, percussionists Butch Trucks and Jai Johanny Johanson play in unison, laying what has been described as \"a thick bed of ride-snare rhythm for the soloists to luxuriate upon.\"[16]\r\n> Duane Allman then[12] starts quietly rephrasing the first theme, gradually building to a high-pitched climax, Berry Oakley's bass guitar playing a strong counterpoint against the band's trademark percussion. Allman cools into a reverie, then starts again, finding an even more furious peak.[15] Parts of this solo would draw comparison to John Coltrane and his sheets of sound,[15] other parts to Miles Davis' classic Kind of Blue album. Duane Allman biographer Randy Poe wrote that \"[Allman]'s playing jazz in a rock context\" reflected the emerging jazz fusion movement, only in reverse.[12] Allman himself told writer Robert Palmer at that time, \"that kind of playing comes from Miles and Coltrane, and particularly Kind of Blue. I've listened to that album so many times that for the past couple of years, I haven't hardly listened to anything else.\"[12] Almost two decades later, Palmer would write of the Allmans, \"that if the musicians hadn't quite scaled Coltrane-like heights, they had come as close as any rock band was likely to get.\"[17] Rolling Stone would say in 2002 that the song's performance found the musicians \"lock[ed] together ... with the grace and passion of the tightest jazz musicians,\"[18] while in 2008, it said the trills, crawls, and sustain of the guitar work represented \"the language of jazz charged with electric R&B futurism.\"[9]\r\n> Following the Duane Allman solo the band drops off to a relatively brief but to-the-point percussion break by Trucks and Johanson reflecting Kind of Blue drummer Jimmy Cobb's work.[12] The full band then enters to recap the mid-tempo second theme, finishing the song abruptly.[12] Several silent beats pass before the Fillmore audience erupts in riotous applause.[12]","meta":"70e30b5cc906f71874a3111380b02cb0","hash":"3a8ea1ed349f3937e55bbda6e8b00f94","time":"2013-09-28T20:42:45Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"music jazz rock instrumentals improvisation rad allmanbros 70s"},

I explained this to Kurt but I thought I'd better reiterate it here. I do not want and will not take a royalty on any record I record. No points. Period. I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible. The band write the songs. The band play the music. It's the band's fans who buy the records. The band is responsible for whether it's a great record or a horrible record. Royalties belong to the band.\r\n> \r\n> I would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what it's worth. The record company will expect me to ask for a point or a point and a half. If we assume three million sales, that works out to 400,000 dollars or so. There's no fucking way I would ever take that much money. I wouldn't be able to sleep.\r\n> \r\n> I have to be comfortable with the amount of money you pay me, but it's your money, and I insist you be comfortable with it as well. Kurt suggested paying me a chunk which I would consider full payment, and then if you really thought I deserved more, paying me another chunk after you'd had a chance to live with the album for a while. That would be fine, but probably more organizational trouble than it's worth.\r\n> \r\n> Whatever. I trust you guys to be fair to me and I know you must be familiar with what a regular industry goon would want. I will let you make the final decision about what I'm going to be paid. How much you choose to pay me will not effect my enthusiasm for the record.\r\n> \r\n> Some people in my position would expect an increase in business after being associated with your band. I, however, already have more work that I can handle, and frankly, the kind of people such superficialities will attract are not people I want to work with. Please don't consider that an issue.","meta":"877e0ef0ef3b0f1c8f7e1ba96abea763","hash":"a943892b12e22e609c6f3218c4f5eff7","time":"2013-09-26T16:48:04Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"music nirvana letters advice compensation money work"},

I think those of us so engaged are abandoning our reliance on voices of authority, and taking up these tools ourselves, and I think that\u2019s good, and important. But at the moment, we seem to be grasping for absolutes, as though part of an empiricist cargo-cult ritual; we crave a number, any number, even if we don\u2019t understand it, so long as it looks precise. And because we have access to very precise-looking data, we feel obliged to represent it precisely.\r\n> This obsession with nominal accuracy, and its conflation with realism, completely misses so many interesting ways to comprehend and explore more complex ideas \u2013 maybe even in simpler forms, and maybe even more truthfully.

In late 1991 - early 1992, a 4 screen (3 walls\/floor) CAVE\u00ae system - now including surround-sound - was completed and premiered at the annual SIGGRAPH Conference. This video provides an overview of the CAVE system\/technology and a glimpse of some of the applications being developed at the time which cover a broad range of scientific and academic disciplines.

Make the crust: blend flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt in a food processor. Add butter and shortening, then pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 4 tablespoons ice water and blend until dough forms a ball, adding more ice water, a half-tablespoon at a time (up to 2 additional tablespoons), if dough is dry. Divide dough in half, flatten into two round disks, wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour.\r\n> \r\n> 2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, make the filling: whisk together sugar, cornstarch, salt and lemon zest. Fold in 4 cups blueberries, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon water. Let stand at room temperature about 45 minutes until juices form. Gently fold in the remaining 2 cups blueberries.\r\n> \r\n> 3. Heat oven to 400 degrees. On a floured surface, roll out one dough round. Transfer rolled-out dough to a 9-inch pie pan and fill with blueberry mixture. Roll out the second dough round, then use it to cover the pie, decoratively crimping together dough edges to seal. Score top crust with a knife so pie can vent. Brush with milk and sprinkle with Demerara sugar.\r\n> \r\n> 4. Place pie pan on a rimmed cookie sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue baking until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling, about 35 minutes more. Spoon any escaped juices onto pie. Transfer to a rack and cool completely before serving.","meta":"16ea7a1bb7bdd0ae40fe737a2b327b6b","hash":"06271e372cc375ec590a0cc59b8396dc","time":"2013-07-31T13:16:39Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"cooking recipes pie fruit summer food blueberries"},

One complaint per table is all, unless you want them to spit in the food. Let me tell you a story about George Jean Nathan, America\u2019s great drama critic. Nathan was the tightest man who ever lived, even tighter than Charles Chaplin. And he lived for 40 years in the Hotel Royalton, which is across from the Algonquin. He never tipped anybody in the Royalton, not even when they brought the breakfast, and not at Christmastime. After about ten years of never getting tipped, the room-service waiter peed slightly in his tea. Everybody in New York knew it but him. The waiters hurried across the street and told the waiters at Algonquin, who were waiting to see when it would finally dawn on him what he was drinking! And as the years went by, there got to be more and more urine and less and less tea. And it was a great pleasure for us in the theater to look at a leading critic and know that he was full of piss. And I, with my own ears, heard him at the \u201821\u2019 complaining, saying, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I get tea here as good as it is at the Royalton?\u201d That\u2019s when I fell on the floor, you know.","meta":"1bfe6eb78efd9c16249bcb3bf3e3a5a9","hash":"8098984381b56f8c0d8de443b88229be","time":"2013-06-17T02:25:13Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"hollywood interview movies"},

In a finite continued fraction (or terminated continued fraction), the iteration\/recursion is terminated after finitely many steps by using an integer in lieu of another continued fraction. In contrast, an infinite continued fraction is an infinite expression. In either case, all integers in the sequence, other than the first, must be positive. The integers ai are called the coefficients or terms of the continued fraction.","meta":"d940d62dd88aa6d8d1b9f70f785614a8","hash":"2c1ef07fa17d6e5130a5bd04cc6cf544","time":"2013-06-13T14:41:05Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"math wikipedia algorithm"},

When shopping, if weighing them, each bunch I bought weighed between 3 to 4 ounces, or 85 to 115 grams, but if you want to be certain, simply weigh them at the market so you know you have the amount called for in the recipe. Once home, pick the parsley and mint leaves from the stems and wash them in a salad spinner. -dl\r\n>\r\n> INGREDIENTS\r\n>\r\n> 3 tablespoons (30g) fine bulgur\r\n> 3 medium (600g) firm ripe tomatoes, diced into small cubes\r\n> 2 (50g) spring onions or scallions, trimmed and very thinly sliced\r\n> 14 ounces (400g) flat-leaf parsley, most of the stalks discarded, leaves washed and dried\r\n> 2 cups (20g) mint leaves (no stems), washed and dried\r\n> 1\/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\r\n> 1\/2 teaspoon ground allspice (or Lebanese seven-spice mixture)\r\n> 1\/4 teaspoon finely ground black pepper\r\n> salt to taste\r\n> juice of 1 lemon, or to taste\r\n> 2\/3 cup (150ml) extra virgin olive oil\r\n> 4 gem lettuce heads, washed and quartered\r\n> \r\n> DIRECTIONS\r\n>\r\n> 1.Rinse the bulgur in several changes of cold water. Drain well and put in a bowl. Stir it with a fork every now and then to help it fluff up.\r\n> \r\n> 2.Put the diced tomatoes in a bowl and set aside while you prepare the herbs. A word of warning: do not chop the herbs with a mezzaluna. This will only bruise them.\r\n> \r\n> Using a razor-sharp knife, grab as much of the parsley and mint as you can handle in a bunch, and slice them very thin, to end up with nice, crisp slender strips.\r\n> \r\n> 3.Drain the tomatoes of their juice and put in a large bowl. Add the spring onion and herbs. Sprinkle the bulgur all over. Season with the cinnamon, allspice and pepper. Add salt to taste. Add the lemon juice and olive oil and mix well.

{"href":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MDcbZYQTim4","description":"Couldn't Get It Right - Climax Blues Band (1976) - YouTube","extended":"Climax Blues Band, originally known as the Climax Chicago Blues Band, was formed in Stafford, England in 1968. The original members were guitarists Peter Haycock and Derek Holt, keyboardist Arthur Wood, bassist Richard Jones, drummer George Newsome, and vocalist and harmonica player Colin Cooper. In 1970, the group shortened its name to the Climax Blues Band due to pressure from the American band Chicago Transit Authority, later known simply as Chicago. The band has released at least seventeen albums and had a Top 10 hit with \"Couldn't Get It Right\", which reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977. Led by Cooper, the former frontman of the R&B group the Hipster Image, the Climax Chicago Blues Band was one of the leading lights of the late 1960s UK blues boom. Prior to the release of 1969's \"Plays On\", Jones left the group, prompting Holt to move to bass. In 1970 they moved to the Harvest Records label, at the same time shifting towards a more rock-oriented sound on \"A Lot Of Bottle\". Around the release of 1971's \"Tightly Knit\", Newsome was replaced by John Cuffley. Upon Wood's exit in the wake of 1972's \"Rich Man\", they continued on as a quartet, also dropping the \"Chicago\" portion of their name at that time. In 1974 the Climax Blues Band issued \"FM Live\", a document of a New York radio concert. 1975's \"Stamp\" was their commercial breakthrough, and 1976's \"Gold Plated\" fared even better, spurred on by the success of the hit single \"Couldn't Get It Right\". By the mid-1970s they were drawing crowds of up to 20,000 at U.S. concerts. However, the rise of punk rock effectively stopped the group in their tracks. Cooper died of cancer at age 69 in July 2008. However, the band continues to tour to the present day. This channel is dedicated to the classic rock hits that have become part of the history of our culture.

Mending clothes was once routine for every stratum of society. British aristocrats were unabashed at their elbow patches \u2014 in truth more prevention than cure, since they protected shooting jackets from wear caused by the shotgun butt. Everything got mended, and mending was a trade.\n\nWhat sort of trade? Highly skilled, perhaps, but manual, consigning it to a low status in a culture that has always been shaped by the ancient Greek preference for thinking over doing (this is one way in which the West differs from the East). Over the course of the 19th century, the \u2018pure\u2019 theorist gained ascendancy over the \u2018applied\u2019 scientist (or worse still, the engineer); likewise, the professional engineer could at least pull rank on the maintenance man: he was a creator and innovator, not a chap with oily rag and tools. \u2018Although central to our relationship with things,\u2019 writes the historian of technology David Edgerton, \u2018maintenance and repair are matters we would rather not think about.\u2019 Indeed, they are increasingly matters we\u2019d rather not even do.\n\nEdgerton explains that, until the mid-20th century, repair was a permanent state of affairs, especially for expensive items such as vehicles, which \u2018lived in constant interaction with a workshop\u2019. It wasn\u2019t so much that things stopped working and then got repaired, but that repair was the means by which they worked at all. Repair might even spawn primary manufacturing industries: many early Japanese bicycles were assembled from the spare parts manufactured to fix foreign (mostly British) models.","meta":"59e0333da7632ec9c42921922e0f009d","hash":"668dd6f1af1e729cd81190b42bd24681","time":"2013-05-31T17:56:41Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"repair diy culture"},

She was attractive, mid-twenties, in great shape, and she was pulling out what, on closer inspection, turned out to be a baby stroller. I looked for a baby, and there it was, sitting on the curb in a carrier. This was all taking place in front of a nail salon, and a woman was sitting in the front window while her nails dried. This woman appeared to be in her mid-to-late-thirties and was well put together, but wearing a denim jacket in a failing attempt to somehow give the illusion of youth. She was staring at the baby and the look in her eyes was one of anguish and desperation. You could almost HEAR her thinking, \u201cThis is never going to happen for me. What choices did I make in my life that brought me to this place where it\u2019s never going to happen for me?\u201d\r\n> \r\n> It smacked me like a wave, and it was one of those New York feelings that you only let yourself feel every three or four years where you\u2019re just overwhelmed by how everything is too close, there\u2019s too much anguish, it\u2019s all too much in your face. The ragged homeless schizophrenic who mutters \u201cI should call my mom, let her know I\u2019m still alive.\u201d The old man sitting alone in the diner ordering one more cup of coffee so that at least he has another few minutes before he has to return to the empty room where he\u2019s the only one who knows or cares that he exists. The exhausted nurse smoking outside the hospital whose voice cracks on the cellphone as she tells her child that there\u2019s something you can warm up in the oven, be sure to do your homework, I have to work a double shift tonight, I won\u2019t be able to walk with you to school in the morning, before she hangs up the phone and lets the tears just roll. It\u2019s all of it, all around you, and it never stops.\r\n> \r\n> Then the next wave smacked me: The aging fat man, unshaven, shirttail hanging out, hunched demeanor, stopped short on the sidewalk staring at a woman in a nail salon. What\u2019s his story? What sadness is he carrying around with him? Why the fuck won\u2019t he keep walking?\r\n> \r\n> So I kept walking. I mean, what else are you gonna do?","meta":"23372b1539695167a8996c3383a81a77","hash":"a7d268885fbfd4563b979c91d4005285","time":"2013-05-31T00:55:15Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"writing nyc"},

We believe that the future of technology will be largely determined by end-users who will design, build, and hack their own devices, and our goal is to inspire, shape, support, and study these communities. To this end, we explore the intersection of computation, physical materials, manufacturing processes, traditional crafts, and design.\r\n","meta":"403e5e5617a13f27d1cd079f2b06cf4a","hash":"afa84f3df33515bf7fa47d1e20bd18e7","time":"2013-05-26T21:50:26Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"design diy hardware arduino"},

Butt now lives in Florida and runs the Official Website of the Original Long Island Iced Tea. \"It's amazing to me how many hits I get,\" he said. \"I probably get forty hits a day.\"\r\n> \r\n> A good Long Island Iced Tea, Butt said, is stealthy: \"When it's made right, you can't tell how strong it is.\" He invented the drink like a child at a soda fountain, taking all the clear liquors at his bar station and mixing them together. When a colleague said it tasted a bit like tea, Butt added a splash of Coke and said, \"Now it looks like tea, too.\" In no time, the Oak Beach Inn was mixing Long Island Iced Teas in the basement and serving them on tap. 41 years later, he got his credit due, when PBS featured him on its \"Inventor\" series.\r\n> \r\n> \"In those days there were no drunk charges for anybody, you could drink whatever you want,\" Butt said. (True in practice then, if not in law: New York state was the first to forbid drunk driving.) \"It was always my suggestion to buy them for girls,\" he said. \"One of those, most young girls were staggering.

Combine 1 tablespoon salt with 3 quarts water in a large bowl or container. Add chicken, cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Drain, rinse with cold water and pat dry.\r\n> 2. Stir together remaining 1 teaspoon salt and the black pepper. Sprinkle half the mixture evenly over chicken.\r\n> 3. In a large sealable plastic bag, combine remaining pepper mixture and flour. Add 2 pieces chicken to bag and shake well to coat. Remove chicken pieces, shaking off extra flour, and set aside. Repeat with remaining chicken.\r\n> 4. Take a large (10- or 12-inch) cast-iron skillet or chicken fryer, for which you have a lid, and fit with a candy or deep-frying thermometer. Add oil and bacon drippings and heat to 360 degrees over medium heat; the oil will ripple and possibly give off a few wisps of smoke.\r\n> 5. Using tongs, immediately add chicken pieces, skin side down (work in batches if necessary to avoid crowding pan). The oil will drop to about 325 degrees, where it should stay; adjust heat so that oil is bubbling gently around the pieces. Cover and cook 6 minutes; uncover and cook 9 minutes. Turn chicken pieces; cover and cook 6 minutes. Uncover and cook another 5 to 9 minutes, depending on size of pieces. If necessary for even browning, turn pieces over a few times toward the end.\r\n> 6. Drain on paper towels or paper bags. Let cool at least 20 minutes before serving.\r\n>\r\n> YIELD 4 servings\r\n> NOTEIf chicken is larger than 2 1\/2 pounds, use a large heavy knife to cut each breast half in half again, making 10 pieces in total.","meta":"22b0a12ea4a7d659b4de3f31644afec4","hash":"728fb5a41a9b80a91fffd2598bc8e06b","time":"2013-05-17T18:52:59Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"chicken fried food recipes cooking nytimes southern"},

{"href":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Santa_Muerte","description":"Santa Muerte","extended":"> Santa Muerte, Spanish for Saint Death, is a sacred figure and feminine skeletal folk saint venerated primarily in Mexico and the United States. As a figure made holy by popular belief, the saint of death developed through syncretism between Mesoamerican indigenous and Spanish Catholic beliefs and practices. Santa Muerte, the name in Spanish, literally translates to \"Saint Death\" or \"Holy Death\". Since the pre-Columbian era Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death, which can be seen in the widespread commemoration of the syncretic Day of the Dead. Elements of that celebration include the use of skeletons to remind people of their mortality. The worship is condemned by the Catholic Church in Mexico as invalid, but it is firmly entrenched among Mexico\u2019s lower working classes and various elements of society deemed as \"outcasts\".\r\n> Santa Muerte generally appears as a female skeletal figure, clad in a long robe and holding one or more objects, usually a scythe and a globe. Her robe can be of any color, as more specific images of the figure vary widely from devotee to devotee and according to the rite being performed or the petition being made. As the worship of Santa Muerte was clandestine until the 20th century, most prayers and other rites have been traditionally performed privately in the home. However, for the past ten years or so, worship has become more public, especially in Mexico City after Enriqueta Romero initiated her famous Mexico City shrine in 2001. The number of believers in Santa Muerte has grown over the past ten to twenty years, to several million followers in Mexico, the United States, and parts of Central America. Santa Muerte has similar male counterparts in the Americas, such as the skeletal folk saints San La Muerte of Argentina and Rey (King) Pascual of Guatemala.","meta":"7db3bdf1ebfad196c5fe4133f4ca3307","hash":"5d26fafa1c0fdfd2fb4a8aaa82e38d07","time":"2013-05-14T14:23:39Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"death mexico mythology religion wikipedia"},

This map was prepared in collaboration with the Geological Survey of Canada and the Mexican Consejo Recursos de Minerales. \r\n> \r\n> This cartographic Tapestry is woven from a geologic map and a shaded relief image. This digital combination reveals the geologic history of North America through the interrelation of rock type, topography and time. Regional surface processes as well as continent-scale tectonic events are exposed in the three dimensions of space and the fourth dimension, geologic time. The large map shows the varying age of bedrock underlying North America, while four smaller maps show the distribution of four principal types of rock: sedimentary, volcanic, plutonic and metamorphic.","meta":"cf6d334bb430b16014fbe418931fcd4c","hash":"00800daff68b5cabd882d5c02fe47b97","time":"2013-04-16T15:40:34Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"usgs pdf maps usa geology"},

The Chronofile was a vast scrapbook that included copies of all his incoming and outgoing correspondence, newspaper clippings, notes and sketches, and even dry cleaning bills. Initially, the Chronofile was bound into handsome leather-backed volumes. In later years, to save space and expenses, the Chronofile was simply stored in boxes.

It was first published by Russian German climatologist Wladimir K\u00f6ppen in 1884, with several later modifications by K\u00f6ppen himself, notably in 1918 and 1936. Later, German climatologist Rudolf Geiger collaborated with K\u00f6ppen on changes to the classification system, which is thus sometimes referred to as the K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger climate classification system. The system is based on the concept that native vegetation is the best expression of climate. Thus, climate zone boundaries have been selected with vegetation distribution in mind. It combines average annual and monthly temperatures and precipitation, and the seasonality of precipitation.","meta":"da1022eb21649aa8813ebabee55cde7c","hash":"962c021ef8da0f17e452707465a23c58","time":"2013-04-05T02:41:42Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"climate history weather"},

It uses the Transfer-Encoding HTTP header in place of the Content-Length header, which the protocol would otherwise require. Because the Content-Length header is not used, the sender does not need to know the length of the content before it starts transmitting a response to the receiver. Senders can begin transmitting dynamically-generated content before knowing the total size of that content.\r\n> The size of each chunk is sent right before the chunk itself so that the receiver can tell when it has finished receiving data for that chunk. The data transfer is terminated by a final chunk of length zero.","meta":"83134e524f32e5debecb0f0beccc898a","hash":"046c7ec79f6404f188080304638f346e","time":"2013-04-05T02:18:31Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"http chunked data internet"},

The sedimentary rock exposed in this dome range in age from Late Proterozoic within the center of the dome to Ordovician sandstone around its edges. The sedimentary rocks comprising this structure dip outward at 10\u00b0-20\u00b0. Differential erosion of resistant layers of quartzite has created high-relief circular cuestas. Its center consists of a siliceous breccia covering an area that is at least 3\u00a0km in diameter.\r\n> \r\n> Initially interpreted as an asteroid impact structure because of its high degree of circularity, it is now argued to be a highly symmetrical and deeply eroded geologic dome.","meta":"f2217d7884f88f9304dd5d515ca1f245","hash":"1843dea6a514abd879a0b6801c7a6812","time":"2013-04-03T21:54:43Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"earth sahara dessert"},

I ended up buying branzino instead, but trout would certainly work for this recipe, as would just about any fish.\r\n> \r\n> 1 1 \u00bd pound whole trout, branzino, or any fish you prefer, gutted and scaled\r\n> \u00bc pound unsalted butter (1 stick), softened\r\n> 4 sprigs each thyme, parsley, dill, rosemary\r\n> 3 cloves garlic\r\n> 2 lemons\r\n> 1 cup dry white wine\r\n> Salt and pepper to taste\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Directions:\r\n> \r\n> This herb butter freezes well and will stay good for at least a month (refrigerated about a week and a half). It\u2019s a great thing to have on hand to make anything fancier (bread, pasta, roasted vegetables) and also a good way to put wilting herbs to use rather than throw them away.\r\n> \r\n> Place your butter in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Finely chop your picked herbs and garlic and add them to the butter. Add 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper and beat until well-mixed. Scoop the butter onto a sheet of plastic wrap and roll it tightly into a tube-shape. Refrigerate until set, about 40 minutes.\r\n> \r\n> Pre-heat your oven to 450 degrees F. Rinse your fish and pat it dry. Salt the inside and outside of the fish well and place it in a shallow baking dish (I had to cut the tail off of mine so that it would fit). Cut half of your herb butter into disks and place the rest in the fridge (you\u2019ll only be using half). Stuff butter disks inside of the fish and top with lemon slices. Do the same on the outside of the fish. Salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Add about 1 cup of dry white wine to the baking dish and cover with tinfoil. Place in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove tinfoil and roast 7-10 more minutes. The meat should release from the bones and you should be able to \u201cunzip\u201d the fish and enjoy the meat easily.","meta":"9cf63bcaf456e8d31d854626baa7b13d","hash":"81ad29f46f12a0c10c159ede12b18190","time":"2013-03-29T15:59:33Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"recipes fish herbs books butter food"},

The Mary Celeste was in seaworthy condition and still under sail heading toward the Strait of Gibraltar. She had been at sea for a month and had over six months' worth of food and water on board. Her cargo was virtually untouched and the personal belongings of passengers and crew were still in place, including valuables. The crew was never seen or heard from again. The Mary Celeste crew's disappearance is often cited as the greatest maritime mystery of all time.","meta":"e3736998ef207c9983e0432fb7e283e6","hash":"b2dee7ee2f3fa566cfa79da7293f68aa","time":"2013-03-28T14:40:59Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"wikipedia shipping history oceans mystery"},

{"href":"http:\/\/www.stevesouders.com\/blog\/2013\/03\/18\/http-archive-jquery\/","description":"HTTP Archive: jQuery | High Performance Web Sites","extended":"This blog post contains many statistics that are useful in deciding whether to load jQuery from Google Hosted Libraries. The pros of requesting jQuery core from Google Hosted Libraries are:\r\n\r\npotential benefit of cross-site caching\r\nease of switching if you\u2019re already loading jQuery core as a standalone request\r\nno hosting, storage, bandwidth, nor maintenance costs\r\nbenefit of Google\u2019s CDN performance\r\n1-year cache time\r\nThe cons to loading jQuery from Google Hosted Libraries include:\r\n\r\nan extra DNS lookup\r\nyou might use a different CDN that\u2019s faster\r\ncan\u2019t combine jQuery with your other scripts\r\nThere are two other more complex but potentially significant issues to think about if you\u2019re considering bundling jQuery with your other scripts. (Thanks to Ilya Grigorik for mentioning these.)\r\n\r\nFirst, combining multiple scripts together increases the likelihood of the resource needing to be updated. This is especially true with regard to bundling with jQuery since jQuery is likely to change less than your site-specific JavaScript.\r\n\r\nSecond, unlike an HTML document, a script is not parsed incrementally. That\u2019s why some folks, like Gmail, load their JavaScript in an iframe segmented into multiple inline script blocks thus allowing the JavaScript engine to parse and execute the initial blocks while the file is still being downloaded. Combining scripts into a single, large script might reach the point where delayed parsing would be offset by downloading two or more scripts. As far as I know this has not been investigated enough to determine how \u201clarge\u201d the script must be to reach the point of negative returns.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re loading core jQuery as a standalone request from your own server (which 38% of sites are doing), you\u2019ll probably get an easy performance boost by switching to Google Hosted Libraries. If you\u2019re considering creating a combined script that includes jQuery, the issues raised here may mean that\u2019s not the optimal solution.\r\n\r\nSteveW and I both agree: To make the best decision, website owners need to test the alternatives. Using a RUM solution like Google Analytics Site Speed, Soasta mPulse, Torbit Insight, or New Relic RUM will tell you the impact on your real users.","meta":"a665a2d5c0a82fff33f00c9815067567","hash":"46a0a58c5063cb78058ee2d3d1096165","time":"2013-03-19T02:47:01Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"jquery performance development cdn"},

{"href":"http:\/\/dp.la\/","description":"Digital Public Library of America","extended":"The vision of a national digital library has been circulating among librarians, scholars, educators, and private industry representatives since the early 1990s, but it has not yet materialized. Efforts led by a range of organizations, including the Library of Congress, HathiTrust, and the Internet Archive, have successfully built resources that provide books, images, historical records, and audiovisual materials to anyone with Internet access. Many universities, public libraries, and other public-spirited organizations have digitized materials that could be brought together under the frame of the DPLA, but these digital collections often exist in silos. Compounding this problem are disparate technical standards, disorganized and incomplete metadata, and a host of legal issues. No project has yet succeeded in bringing these different viewpoints, experiences, and collections together with leading technical experts and the best of private industry to find solutions to these complex challenges. Users have neither coherent access to these materials nor tools to use them in new and exciting ways, and institutions have no clear blueprint for creating a shared infrastructure to serve the public good. The time is right to launch an ambitious project to realize the great promise of the Internet for the advancement of sharing information and of using technology to enable new knowledge and discoveries in the United States.","meta":"996a3d34b5e52e852ad227e7a7faa1cd","hash":"afcc08a502a49ba3ee89d9785e537d28","time":"2013-03-05T17:43:10Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"library internet history books research archives"},

Ninety-nine percent of the species that have lived on Earth have gone extinct, including more than five tool-using hominids. A quick glance at the fossil record could frighten you into thinking that Earth is growing more dangerous with time. If you carve the planet's history into nine ages, each spanning five hundred million years, only in the ninth do you find mass extinctions, events that kill off more than two thirds of all species. But this is deceptive. Earth has always had her hazards; it's just that for us to see them, she had to fill her fossil beds with variety, so that we could detect discontinuities across time.

We attend to the social life of the book. Publication Studio is a laboratory for publication in its fullest sense\u2014not just the production of books, but the production of a public.

{"href":"http:\/\/www.ubu.com\/ethno\/","description":"U B U W E B :: E T H N O P O E T I C S","extended":"The breakthroughs of the last 100 years in poetry and elsewhere have been marked by new approaches to language and performance. Largely this has been the work of several generations of experimental writers and performers, many of them now archived and available thru Ubuweb and related web sites. It fell to some of us, starting with forerunners like Tristan Tzara and Antonin Artaud, to track related but traditional approaches over a wide range of once impenetrable cultures throughout the world. In my own work I was able to bring some of these lines together in gatherings of the 1960s and 1970s like Technicians of the Sacred and Shaking the Pumpkin, as well as in the magazine Alcheringa that I co-edited for several years with Dennis Tedlock. The name that we gave this enterprise, as it applied to the world\u2019s deep cultures \u2013 those surviving in situ as well as those that had vanished except for transcriptions in books or recordings from earlier decades \u2013 was ethnopoetics.\r\n\r\nIn the present Ubuweb collection of ethnopoetic openings, it\u2019s our intention to build a sampler of what we take to be the second great breakthrough of the modernist poetry project. The search here is for a range of poetries outside the domain of customarily accepted literature. In particular we\u2019re interested, in the spirit of other segments of Ubuweb, in soundings and visionings that are the traditional and often culturally acceptable counterparts to what in our own surroundings have been seen and heard as radical, even disturbing departures from conventional practice. In exploring these we will also be mindful of occasions on which the avant-garde experimental line has merged with or deliberately drawn from other culturally specific traditions.\r\n\r\nWe proceed in the spirit of Gertrude Stein, often quoted by me: The exciting thing about all this is that as it is new it is old and as it is old it is new, but now we have come to be in our way which is an entirely different way.\r\n\r\n\u00a0 - Jerome Rothenberg, October 2002 \r\n","meta":"07d6b2d489c41ab6c7d1e1b3b97bbc36","hash":"f1f0d0d8df0cd264e56c197114c47c9b","time":"2013-02-15T00:44:51Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"poetry history language ubuweb"},

This architectural style was used in order to protect residents from Bedouin attacks. While Shibam has been in existence for an estimated 1,700 years, most of the city's houses originate from the 16th century. Many, though, have been rebuilt numerous times in the last few centuries.\r\n\r\nShibam is often called \"the oldest skyscraper city in the world\" or \"the Manhattan of the desert\", and is one of the oldest and best examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction. The city has some of the tallest mud buildings in the world, with some of them over 30 meters (100\u00a0feet) high, thus being early high-rise apartment buildings. In order to protect the buildings from rain and erosion, the walls must be routinely maintained by applying fresh layers of mud. \r\n","meta":"d4c67cfe025c4428edade1ffea05c43c","hash":"79f34d68f3cce540f9df4f4101f00e21","time":"2013-02-11T19:03:57Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"yemen city building structures urbanism"},

He said: No one cares what you do unless you think about it and no one cares what you think unless you do it.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/straup.github.com\/parallel-flickr\/\r\n\r\nParallel Flickr is an exercise to create a living breathing archive of my Flickr photos. Not a replacement but something other than the usual cold storage backup systems we've all grown used to. It was also an exercise to work through the idea of what it means for an individual to take a more active responsibility in archiving the digital bits that are left all over the internet.\r\n\r\nParallel Flickr is meant to run alongside the site itself and be a ready alternative if ever the worst happened and Flickr shut down. The really important piece of this setup is that it mirrors are the URL structures of Flickr itself. The domain name might change but otherwise all the URLs should just keep working.\r\n\r\nOne day I was talking with my friend Mike about all of this. He asked me: Does it make more sense for me to run a single instance of parallel-flickr for my five friends or should they all run their own copy?\r\n\r\nThe beauty of Parallel Flickr is that you can do either, or both. If you and I merge our copies of Parallel Flickr and we encounter collisions across numeric identifiers it just means that we each have a copy of the same photo.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThis is the neighbourhood I moved to, in Brooklyn. It's called Gowanus Heights and it's a neighbourhood that didn't exist before we got there. About a month after we arrived I spent close to 20 minutes, one afternoon, trying to figure out what neighbourhood the various location-based web services thought my street corner was part of. I still don't know.\r\n\r\nThere aren't that many neighbourhoods to choose from so eventually I just created one. This is just an anecdote so don't worry too much about how the social geographies of New York City fit together but if real estate agents can do this then why can't I? This is how culture is made, right?\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nWhat if we could issue unique identifiers for every instance of a design object. A coffee maker for instance or, if we want to side-step the privacy question altogether, fire hydrants. Each fire hydrant would be able to exist as an atomic, addressable entity but still be able to point back to their heritage, so to speak, both as physical (geographic) and cultural objects.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe whole point of putting our collections online is so that they will be there in 50 years. In 100 years. They will still call back when addressed because that's, I thought, the business we were all in keeping this stuff.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nBecause this is what 2012 looks like for museums.\r\n\r\nIt is most definitely not about Twitter but about the fact that some random person out there on the Internet is building a record of understanding about Roombas that may well rival anything we will ever do ourselves.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, we are being forced to accept the fact that our collections are becoming \"alive\". Or at least they are assuming the plausible illusion of being alive.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nOne of the tiny victories in the alpha version of the new Cooper-Hewitt collections website is calling out that although there might have been 400 objects in an exhibition we will only show six of them. But that's only going to buy a very limited amount of grace time. How long before someone out there, who has nothing to do with museums, starts building websites that pull in data from all the participating museum websites to create an exhibitions site that reflects, well, reality?\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nIf we're going to keep telling people that we have all this nice stuff and that its in their interest that we keep it we need to be able to at least prove that it exists.\r\n","meta":"c24a939567d5dc993945426f3d489e51","hash":"1aa2e150c4bc78d491066a093872790b","time":"2013-02-07T22:39:40Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"art future internet technology newaesthetic code flickr geolocation"},

Then you\u2019ll have to defocus from your business so you can learn how to go after developers, learn how to explain what you need in a way they\u2019ll understand, learn how to work with developers, and then, after all that, pay them. All this learning takes a lot of time and resources you could be using to build up your business.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for cheap software. Companies that undervalue their product are not only bound to failure, but even worse, many already know it. That\u2019s the reason why you see a lot of them selling cheap lifetime licenses of their software. It\u2019s the best way of saying \u201cHey, I know you won\u2019t be here for too long, so we\u2019ll just make a quick buck and soon when our solution doesn\u2019t fit you anymore you can just throw it away, which doesn\u2019t matter because we\u2019ll already have our profit.\u201d\r\n\r\nLifetime licenses are outdated strategies used by companies with short customer lifecycle, and it goes without saying that costumer lifecycle is the best metric for knowing how good, or how bad, a product or service really is.\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\ninteresting perspective on open source - it does take a lot of time & resources for clients to learn the lingo of the web. usually the software solution that's a little more expensive is worth it in the long run.","meta":"bf9a6ac729c8cf5136a73b25167c595f","hash":"cf5309025861d524c8f0a796763e91d3","time":"2013-02-07T00:59:34Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"opensource software clients work advice"},

Grant in 1872, followed by Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" National parks usually have a variety of natural resources over large areas. Many of them had been previously protected as National Monuments by the President under the Antiquities Act before being upgraded by Congress. Seven national parks are paired with a National Preserve, six of which are in Alaska. While administered together, they are considered as separate units and their areas are not included in the figures below.

Begun in AD 122, during the rule of emperor Hadrian, it was the first of two fortifications built across Great Britain, the second being the Antonine Wall, lesser known of the two because its physical remains are less evident today.\r\n\r\nThe wall was the most heavily fortified border in the Empire. In addition to its role as a military fortification, it is thought that many of the gates through the wall would have served as customs posts to allow trade and levy taxation.\r\n\r\nA significant portion of the wall still exists, having been rescued in the 19th century by John Clayton, who, alarmed at the destruction by quarrying, bought a number of sections.

In my experience, creative and intellectual work flows from physical engagement with the landscape. There are literal manifestations of this, such as the discovery of forgotten places and the collection of forgotten literature from the shelves of a rural shop. More intangibly, the processes of walking, hiking, or taking a road trip are useful activities for developing new ideas or thinking through puzzles.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThis sounds like I\u2019m emphasizing the differences between analog and digital modes of access, and I am, but with the intent of showing that they can be so different from one another that they complement and do not compete with each other. The physical library offers not just a single irreproducible experience\u2014browsing\u2014but thousands of irreproducible experiences of browsing-based discovery. Looked at in this way, my point is to reframe what\u2019s too often a competition between digital access and analog browsing. I see them as very different, and most effective when they are combined and dovetailed.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nI am intrigued when I\u2019m asked how I feel about our inability to save everything, as if this should make me sad. Why are we so focused on completism? The idea that a complete archives of human activity and experience constitutes a good thing isn\u2019t by any means a new idea, but it gained currency a few years back when technological advances convinced many of us that collecting and preserving everything was possible. Then, just as in feature bloat, possibility turned into desirability. The data firehose has convinced us that selection is impossible, and we assume that decisions as to what we save will be determined purely by our IT capabilities. That cultural and social criteria (not to mention power differentials) might actively determine what we preserve\u2014well, that\u2019s turned into an oldskool idea.","meta":"5289c5290ebd3b51c4b7f2eaccb46ac9","hash":"f6bb09a5c24597896c1d255dff281438","time":"2013-01-31T17:14:34Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"Reading.am library reading research archiving film books america"},

{"href":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shine_On_You_Crazy_Diamond","description":"Shine On You Crazy Diamond - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","extended":"Parts I\u2013V\r\n\r\nAs neither the original vinyl release (1975) nor the CD re-release actually delineates precisely the various divisions, the make-up of the parts below is based on a comparison of the recorded timings with the identifications in the published sheet music. Without benefit of the publication, it is easy to perceive Parts I and II as Part I, Part III as Part II, and so on, with the extensive postlude of Part V (at 11:15) as the beginning of the fifth section.\r\n\r\nPart I (Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 0:00 \u2013 3:54) begins with the fade-in of a dense G-minor synthesizer pad created with an EMS VCS 3, ARP Solina, a Hammond organ and the sounds of wet fingers rubbing the rims of wine glasses (recycled from an earlier project known as \"Household Objects\"). This is followed by plaintive Minimoog passages followed by a lengthy, bluesy guitar solo played by Gilmour on a Fender Stratocaster (neck pickup) using a heavily compressed sound and reverb. The harmony changes from G minor to D minor at 2:29, then to C minor, and back to G minor. This is repeated again, and the part ends with the synth pad fading into the background.\r\n\r\nPart II (Waters, Gilmour, Wright; from 3:55 \u2013 6:26) begins with a four-note theme (B\u266d, F, G, E) repeated throughout much of the entire section. This theme leads the harmony to C major (in comparison to the use of C minor in Parts I and II). Mason starts his drumming after the fourth playing of the four-note theme, which is the point where the riffs get into a fixed tempo, in 6\/4 time. The chord leads back to G minor (as from Part I), followed by Eb major and D major back to a coda from G minor. This part includes another solo by Gilmour.\r\n\r\nPart III (Gilmour, Wright, Waters; from 6:27 \u2013 8:41) begins with a Minimoog solo by Wright. This part includes Gilmour's third guitar solo, which is bluesy in tone, and ends with a fade into Part IV. When performed on the Animals tour, Gilmour added distortion to the guitar for this solo (This bluesy guitar solo is often dropped in live performances whilst the rest of part III is still played\u2014notably Delicate Sound of Thunder and Pulse.)\r\n\r\nPart IV (Waters, Gilmour, Wright; from 8:42 \u2013 11:14) Waters is the lead vocalist, with Gilmour, Wright and female backing vocalists on harmonies.\r\n\r\nPart V (Waters, Gilmour, Wright; from 11:15 \u2013 13:40) Part IV is followed by two guitars repeating an arpeggio riff for about a minute with the theme of Part II. A baritone saxophone overlays the sounds, played by Dick Parry. It ends as the saxophone changes from a baritone to a tenor saxophone. After, a time signature switch from 6\/8 to 12\/8 creates the appearance that the tempo speeds up, though the arpeggio guitar part in the background remains unchanged. The sax solo is accompanied by an ARP string synthesizer keyboard sound. A machine-like hum fades in and segues into \"Welcome to the Machine\".\r\n\r\nParts VI\u2013IX\r\n\r\nPart VI (Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 0:00 \u2013 4:55) begins with a howling wind from the preceding song \"Wish You Were Here\". As the wind fades away, Gilmour comes in on the bass guitar. Waters adds another bass with a continuing riff pattern. Then Wright comes in playing an ARP String Ensemble Synthesizer and after a few measures, several rhythm guitar parts (Gilmour played the power chord rhythm part using his black Fender Stratocaster before switching to lap steel guitar for the solo in live performances from 1974-77. Snowy White did the rhythm guitar parts on this track on the band's 1977 \"In the Flesh\" tour) and drums come in, as well as a Minimoog synthesizer to play the opening solo. At the two minute mark, Wright's Minimoog and Gilmour's lap steel guitar play notes in unison before Gilmour does a lap steel guitar solo (the lap steel had open E minor tuning) with some counterpointing from Wright's synthesizers. It lasts for about three minutes (four when played on the band's \"In the Flesh\" tour) and Gilmour played each section an octave higher than the previous one. The highest note he hit on the lap steel\/slide solo was a B-flat nearly three octaves above middle C, followed by a reprise of the guitar solo from Part IV (which was played by White live on Pink Floyd's 1977 tour so Gilmour could switch from the lap steel guitar back to his Fender Stratocaster). The song then switches time signatures to 6\/4 (found in Parts II-V), giving the appearance of a slower tempo and reintroducing the vocals.\r\n\r\nPart VII (Waters, Gilmour, Wright; from 4:56 \u2013 6:04) contains the vocals, almost identical to Part IV (though half the length) before segueing into Part VIII.\r\n\r\nPart VIII (Gilmour, Wright, Waters; from 6:05 \u2013 8:59) brings in Waters to play a second electric guitar for a high-noted sound riff while Gilmour plays the arpeggio riff that bridges Parts VII and VIII. A solid progression of funk in 4\/4 plays for about two minutes before very slowly fading out as a single sustained keyboard note fades in around the nine-minute mark. Throughout this section, Wright's keyboards dominate, with the use of a Minimoog synthesizer, and a Hohner Clavinet. However, when this section was played live on the band's 1977 \"In the Flesh\" tour, the sound was filled out by both Gilmour and White, who would trade guitar solos in a duet (or known as the battle between Gilmour's black with white pick-ups Strat and White's Goldtop Gibson Les Paul) which would extend this section upwards to between five and ten minutes.\r\n\r\nPart IX (Wright, from 9:00 \u2013 12:31) is played in 4\/4 time. Gilmour described Part IX in an interview as \"a slow 4\/4 funeral march... the parting musical eulogy to Syd\". Again, Wright's keyboards dominate, with little guitar input from Gilmour. The drums play for half of this part, and the keyboards play for the final minute before fading out. On the fade-out, a short keyboard part of the melody of \"See Emily Play\" (at 12:12), one of Barrett's signature Pink Floyd songs, can be heard; live versions additionally featured snippets of \"Bike\", \"The Gnome\", \"The Scarecrow\", and \"Arnold Layne\". When played live on the 1977 tour, the piano plays the chords on its own before the synthesizer solo was slowly changed from itself (early part of European leg) into half synthesizer and harmony guitar solo by Gilmour (higher notes) and White (lower notes; on the end of the European leg and April and May, 1977 US performances) and then first a bluesy Gilmour solo followed by a harmony guitar solo by Gilmour (higher notes) and White (lower notes; on the June and July, 1977 US performances) finally before ending with the synthesizer solo as on record. Part IX, and the album, ends on G major, a Picardy third.","meta":"f82f950c02bb9c7981e335c185d1679e","hash":"51f584c9b471e37943868051b33c7a62","time":"2013-01-31T16:05:51Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"music pink.floyd wikipedia songs"},

Certainly its size and the fact that millions upon millions of people have access to and actually use it make it unlike anything the world has ever seen before, and I don't want to downplay those accomplishments. But it's hard to discern what is genuinely new about Wikipedia and what falls in line with historical patterns if you only compare it to the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Instead, when you place Wikipedia in a longer timeframe, it seems that the historical anomaly was not today's online collaboration, but the 20th century's professionalized, bureaucratically produced tomes.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this seems to be true of so many of the Internet's \"innovations\": Blogs look like 18th- and 19th-century publishers more than they do The New York Times or The Washington Post; small crafters selling their wares on Etsy look more like earlier markets than the 20th century's big chains. We have a tendency to reach for the most recent historical examples as our benchmarks, but when you take a longer view, you see that we haven't so much as broken with the past as repeated it.\r\n\r\n","meta":"5206427123fe2236188ddd9cbc97fb2c","hash":"e8fa3b9f526e79409485c67776ebc1ac","time":"2013-01-31T15:58:13Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"history internet wikipedia blogs writing authorship economics"},

I know that when I die the first line in my obituary is going to include the phrases \"securities fraud\" and \"banned for life.\" It would not be inaccurate to call me the poster boy for the kind of insider dealing and duplicity that made Americans realize just how rigged the game is against them. In fact, you could say that I'm the guy who caused the financial crisis and all the suffering we are still going through five years later. Sure, it would be overblown and largely inaccurate, needlessly overdramatizing a minor issue just to get attention and maybe make a point, but still, you could say it. I mean, yes, the fact that I have been able to move on to my current career, and to do quite well from it, is a testament to the total decline in the traditional concepts of personal responsibility and moral behavior to which the men of every preceding generation in this country had to adhere if they wanted to consider themselves decent human beings. Thirty years ago someone found culpable of the kinds of gross fraud and deceit I perpetrated would have thrown themselves out a window or gassed themselves in a garage, and while people would have shook their heads and muttered a few things about how awful suicide is, deep down they would have thought, \"Well, good for him; at least in the end he did the only right and honorable thing he could have done.\" But today, so long as you have a total lack of shame about your actions, not only can you survive the justified opprobrium of society, you can do quite well from it. It's weirdly freeing: Once you realize that, for the rest of your life, everyone is going to point fingers at you in the public square and hiss, \"Scumbag,\" having them also think you're an idiot is a small price to pay, particularly if you can monetize that imbecility. Is there a sweeter revenge than coming to the point where your personage is so tarnished that even you stop caring what people think of you? Once you get past the very real truth that everyone thinks you're a vile, disgusting human being you can let yourself do almost anything without worrying that people will laugh at you. So what if they laugh? More money for me! Admit it, you even occasionally entertain a grudging admiration for my talents. Some days you find yourself envious of my ability to go about life with a complete disregard for the utter lack of esteem every even marginally respectable person in the world holds for me.\r\n\r\n","meta":"6cbbce86d7f363894e3ab6aea849821e","hash":"556ef2c6022ef58d7e6e89e205f0977b","time":"2013-01-30T16:25:40Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"lol satire trolls internet"},

As Variety reports, the website features thousands of rare and out-of-print LPs, 78s and 45s in a new digital download section called Vinyl Vaults.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been digitizing a lot,\u201d co-owner Jim Henderson tells Variety. \u201cWhat you see now is the lost-between-the-cracks, underappreciated, undervalued (music) from dead labels, (obscure) artists, stuff that we really stand behind. It\u2019s mostly in the rock genre, with a lot of jazz, a lot of blues, some country, some spoken word. There are some oddities for sure.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmoeba is remastering much of the music, and while there are only about 1,000 titles for sale right now, they are adding 10 or 15 more every day.

For text of length n and p patterns of combined length m, its average and best case running time is O(n+m) in space O(p), but its worst-case time is O(nm). In contrast, the Aho\u2013Corasick string matching algorithm has asymptotic worst-time complexity O(n+m) in space O(m).\r\nA practical application of Rabin\u2013Karp is detecting plagiarism. Given source material, Rabin\u2013Karp can rapidly search through a paper for instances of sentences from the source material, ignoring details such as case and punctuation.

Roughly the size of a pack of cigarettes the device has only one toggle switch to cycle through samples, a combined power and dial and an integrated speaker. The device contains a chip holding nine digitally-encoded (drones) ranging in length from 1.5 to 40 seconds. The name and idea derived from a popular Chinese device that intones repeating loops of Buddhist chanting. In an interview with the public radio show Studio 360 regarding the creation of the Buddha Machine, Virant said he was inspired by a device found in a Buddhist temple. Attracted to its design, he applied it as a means of presenting his loop-based music.\r\n\r\nFollowing the original, two new editions of the Buddha Machine have been released: the second unit, released in 2008, features nine new loops and pitch control. The third unit (entitled Chan Fang \u7985\u623f; translated as Zen Room) and released in 2010, replaced the electronic drones on the first units with loops performed on the Gu Qin, an ancient Chinese classical instrument. Following these new releases, the band also produced iPhone and iPad apps that have similar functionality to the physical devices. In November 2012, the fourth generation Buddha Machine was released, containing 8 new loops and shipped with one of four day-glo case colours.","meta":"ac2ee3cdc60b07d8543ab290e7fad93e","hash":"d75e11ac2dbb086fd7b67c6aefa2272a","time":"2013-01-29T05:44:41Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"ambient music loops electronic china"},

It has been discussed in literature since 1972 when the sentence was used by William J. Rapaport, an associate professor at the University at Buffalo. It was posted to Linguist List by Rapaport in 1992. It was also featured in Steven Pinker's 1994 book The Language Instinct as an example of a sentence that is \"seemingly nonsensical\" but grammatical. Pinker names his student Annie Senghas as the inventor of the sentence.\r\n\r\nThe sentence's intended meaning becomes clearer when it's understood that it uses the city of Buffalo, New York and the somewhat-uncommon verb \"to buffalo\" (meaning \"to bully or intimidate\"), and when the punctuation and grammar is expanded so that the sentence reads as follows: \"Buffalo buffalo that Buffalo buffalo buffalo, buffalo Buffalo buffalo.\" The meaning becomes even clearer when synonyms are used: \"Buffalo-origin bison that other Buffalo bison intimidate, themselves bully Buffalo bison.\"","meta":"55c5c7a9d677b51c8f7e67a0668f8860","hash":"7b6a6b47e7943997c134de75f9a9b903","time":"2013-01-28T17:37:26Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"english language linguistics wikipedia grammar"},

At issue is the code created during the Obama for America (OFA) 2012 campaign: the digital architecture behind the campaign\u2019s website, its system for collecting donations, its email operation, and its mobile app. When the campaign ended, these programmers wanted to put their work back into the coding community for other developers to study and improve upon. Politicians in the Democratic party felt otherwise, arguing that sharing the tech would give away a key advantage to the Republicans. Three months after the election, the data and software is still tightly controlled by the president and his campaign staff, with the fate of the code still largely undecided. It\u2019s a choice the OFA developers warn could not only squander the digital advantage the Democrats now hold, but also severely impact their ability to recruit top tech talent in the future.","meta":"040c38e2f688d8ed04a936c0d9d60baf","hash":"5864374096b20c474da118299d7ac5f8","time":"2013-01-22T21:49:15Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"politics obama opensource software technology"},

{"href":"http:\/\/zythophile.wordpress.com\/2013\/01\/11\/the-real-20-most-influential-beers-of-all-time\/","description":"The REAL 20 most influential beers of all time | Zythophile","extended":"1 Spaten Dunkel The lagering techniques Gabriel Sedlmayr perfected at the family brewery in Munich, and the yeast that he used and then so generously donated to brewers from Carlsberg in Denmark to Heineken in the Netherlands were what powered the lager revolution in Europe and around the world. Without the work done at the Spaten brewery, there would have been no Pilsner Urquell. But the original Spaten lager (and indeed the first lagers brewed outside Bavaria) were all dark beers, little known by modern drinkers, which is why their importance has been forgotten.\r\n\r\n2 Pilsner Urquell The genius of the men who set up the Burghers\u2019 Brewery in Plsen in 1842 appears to have been in combining Bavarian lager yeast and lagering techniques with pale malt made in the English fashion, to produce the world\u2019s first pale lager. It took another half a century or more for the Pilsner style to triumph over its darker rivals even in continental Europe, but most of the beer drunk in the world today has its roots in Bohemia.\r\n\r\n3 Hodgson\u2019s East India Pale Ale There\u2019s a good case for saying that Bass Pale Ale, as the most successful IPA of the 19th and 20th centuries, should fly the flag for the style. But Hodgson\u2019s brewery in Bow, London was the maker of the highly hopped pale beer shipped out east whose success inspired the Burton brewers to follow with their own beers brewed for the Indian trade, beers that later proved popular back home in Britain as well. Therefore it\u2019s Hodgson that deserves to be on the \u201cmost influential\u201d list, even though the Bow brewery eventually collapsed into obscurity.\r\n\r\n4 Parsons\u2019 porter We have no good evidence as to who, if anyone, first turned London brown beer into what became known as porter: it looks as if the city\u2019s whole brown beer trade slowly moved in the first 30 or so years of the 18th century towards a hoppier, more aged style of dark beer that eventually became hugely popular. But there IS evidence that the pioneer of lengthy storage for porter in huge vats, to perfect its flavour, was Sir Humphrey Parsons, of the Red Lion brewery, by St Katharine\u2019s Dock, to the east of the Tower of London, which would make him the most influential porter brewer, since everybody else copied his idea. And without porter we wouldn\u2019t have stout.\r\n\r\n5 Barclay Perkins Russian Imperial Stout A number of London brewers were exporting very strong stouts to the Baltic lands in the 19th century, but Barclay Perkins\u2019s Anchor brewery is the earliest we have evidence for, the best-known and the longest\u2013lasting. Its imperial stout influenced brewers in Poland, the smaller Baltic states and Germany in the 19th century, and American craft brewers in the late 20th and 21st centuries.\r\n\r\n6 Schwechater Lagerbier Anton Dreher was a big pal of Gabriel Sedlmayr and accompanied the Bavarian on his \u201cstudy tours\u201d. At the family brewery in Schwechat, just outside Vienna, Dreher used Sedlmayr\u2019s lagering ideas and, like the brewers in Plsen, malting techniques based on those used by English brewers, though Dreher produced darker malts than the Bohemians, to give a beer halfway in colour between Pilsner and a Munich Dunkel. Think Sam Adams Boston lager, and you\u2019d be about right. Dreher\u2019s is the influence on all those lagers that look more like English bitters in colour.\r\n\r\n7 Einbecker Ur-Bock Without the Einbeckers of Lower Saxony, there would be no Bock beers.\r\n\r\n8 Paulaner Salvator And without Munich\u2019s Salvator, the first of the souped-up Doppelbocks, we wouldn\u2019t have all those beers ending in -or.\r\n\r\n9 Anheuser-Busch Budweiser Come on \u2013 of course it was hugely influential. It pioneered national beer distribution around the US, and it set the standard for what American beer was expected to be. You might not like that standard, but millions of drinkers did, and do, in the US and abroad.\r\n\r\n10 Bass No 1 Best-known of the strong Burton Ales, this was the beer that other barley wines wanted to be, until number 16 on my list came along.\r\n\r\n11 Schneider Weisse Who should carry the banner for Bavarian wheat beer, a style that was restricted to little old Bavarian ladies only 40 years ago but which has since bounced back hugely and now has imitators everywhere? There are several candidates, but I\u2019ll give it to the guys from Kelheim, because they brew nothing else.\r\n\r\n12 Hoegaarden When it comes to Belgian wheat beer, however, there can be only one original, and all the rest are imitators (even if some now, whisper it, might be doing a better job). When Pierre Celis rescued this style from the grave, he was to have far more influence than he could have possibly imagined.\r\n\r\n13 Duvel Anyone brewing a strong, golden Belgian-style ale is bowing towards Breendonk.\r\n\r\n14 Fuller\u2019s ESB A winter-only brew to begin with, ESB became famous as the strongest bitter in Britain, and spawned a new style in the US.\r\n\r\n15 Newcastle Brown Ale First and best-known of the fruity dark amber \u201cNorthern brown ales\u201d.\r\n\r\n16 Tennent\u2019s Gold Label The Sheffield brewer Tennent\u2019s launched its golden barley wine more than 60 years ago, inspiring a host of imitators among brewers who had previously believed strong beers had to be dark.\r\n\r\n17 Fowler\u2019s Wee Heavy Wee Heavy is a much misunderstood style: it\u2019s not that old and it certainly shouldn\u2019t be made with smoked malt. But Fowler\u2019s is the one everybody copied.\r\n\r\n18 Sierra Nevada Pale Ale See above\r\n\r\n19 Blind Pig IPA See above\r\n\r\n20 Goose Island Bourbon County Stout See above","meta":"327ad314d18be5fee10d37db48884279","hash":"966803bb4d76783a5111067ee434cc9a","time":"2013-01-18T19:06:25Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"beer food list"},

{"href":"https:\/\/www.docracy.com\/3884\/contract-of-works-for-web-design","description":"Contract of Works for Web Design\/Development","extended":"Between Designer's Name at Company Name and Customer's name \r\n\r\nSummary\r\nWe will always do our best to fulfil your needs and meet your goals, but sometimes it is best to have a few simple things written down so that we both know what is what, who should do what and what happens if things go wrong. In this contract you won't find complicated legal terms or large passages of unreadable text. We have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. We do want what's best for the safety of both parties, now and in the future.\r\n\r\nIn short\r\n\r\nYou, Customer's name, are hiring Company Name located at Company's Address  to design and develop a web site for the estimated total price of \u00a3 Price outlined in our previous correspondence. The agreed payment plan is at the end of the document. \r\n\r\nWhat do both parties agree to do? \r\n\r\nAs our customer, you have the power and ability to enter into this contract on behalf of your company or organization. You agree to provide us with everything that we need to complete the project including text, images and other information as and when we need it, and in the format that we ask for. You agree to review our work, provide feedback and sign-off approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways and you will also be bound by any dates that we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.\r\n\r\nWe have the experience and ability to perform the services you need from us and we will carry them out in a professional and timely manner. Along the way we will endeavour to meet all the deadlines set but we can't be responsible for a missed launch date or a deadline if you have been late in supplying materials or have not approved or signed off our work on-time at any stage. On top of this we will also maintain the confidentiality of any information that you give us.\r\n\r\nDetails of the works\r\nWe will create designs for the look-and-feel, layout and functionality of your web site. This contract includes one main design plus the opportunity for you to make up to two rounds of revisions. If you're not happy with the designs at this stage, you will pay us in full for all of the work that we have produced until that point and you may either cancel this contract or continue to commission us to make further design revisions at the daily rate set out in our original estimate.\r\n\r\nHTML\/CSS layout templates\r\n\r\nIf the project includes XHTML or HTML markup and CSS templates, we will develop these using valid HTML5 markup and CSS3 for styling. We will test all our markup and CSS in current versions of all major browsers including those made by Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla and Opera. We will also test to ensure that pages will display visually in a similar, albeit not necessarily an identical way, in Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 for Windows as this browser is now past its sell-by date.\r\n\r\nWe will not test these templates in old or abandoned browsers, for example Microsoft Internet Explorer 5, 5.5 or 6 for Windows or Mac, previous versions of Apple's Safari, Mozilla Firefox or Opera unless otherwise specified. If you need to show the same or similar visual design to visitors using these older browsers, we will charge you at the daily rate set out in our original estimate for any necessary additional code and its testing.\r\n\r\nText content \r\n\r\nWe are not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy unless we specified it in the original estimate. We'll be happy to help though, and in addition to the estimate we will charge you at \u00a3 Hourly Copy Fee per hour, including a free initial consultation, for copy writing or content input. \r\n\r\nPhotographs \r\n\r\nIf needed, you will supply us photographs either in digital or printed format. If you choose to buy stock photographs we can suggest vendors of stock photography. Any time we spend searching for or taking appropriate photographs will be charged at \u00a3Hourly Photo Fee per hour, after a free initial consultation to determine if this is the best route to take.\r\n\r\nChanges and revisions \r\n\r\nWe know from plenty of experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your first idea about how something should look, or how it might work. We don't want to limit  either your options or your opportunities to change your mind.\r\n\r\nThe estimate\/quotation prices at the beginning of this document are based on the number of days that we estimate we'll need to accomplish everything that you have told us you want to achieve. If you do want to change your mind, add extra pages or templates or even add new functionality, that won't be a problem. You will be charged the daily rate set out in the estimate we gave you. Along the way we might ask you to put requests in writing so we can keep track of changes.\r\n\r\nTechnical support \r\n\r\nYou may already have professional web site hosting, you might even manage that hosting in-house; if that's the case, great. If you don't manage your own web site hosting, we can set up an account for you at one of our preferred, third-party hosting providers. We will charge you a one-off fee for installing your site on this server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics; then the updates to, and management of that server, plus any support issues will be up to you.\r\n\r\nWe are not a web site hosting company and so we do not offer or include technical support for web site hosting, email or other services relating to web site hosting. If you do require help with anything beyond the design and development of your site, we'll be happy to help.\r\n\r\nLegal stuff \r\nWe can't guarantee that the functions contained in any web page templates or in a completed web site will always be error-free and so we can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate this web site and any other web pages, even if you have advised us of the possibilities of such damages.\r\n\r\nIf any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.\r\n\r\nCopyrights \r\nYou guarantee to us that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide us for inclusion in the web site are either owned by your good selfs, or that you have permission to use them. \r\n\r\nWhen we receive your final payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows: \r\n\r\nYou own the graphics and other visual elements that we create for you for this project. We will give you a copy of all files and you should store them really safely as we are not required to keep them or provide any native source files that we used in making them. \r\n\r\nYou also own text content, photographs and other data you provided, unless someone else owns them. We own the XHTML markup, CSS and other code and we license it to you for use on only this project. \r\n\r\nWe love to show off our work and share what we have learned with other people, so we  also reserve the right to display and link to your completed project as part of our portfolio and to write about the project on web sites, in magazine articles and in books about web design. \r\n\r\nPayments \r\nWe are sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly.  As we're also sure you'll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule, which will be as follows, but may be revised based on further conversations between us.\r\n\r\n50% of total estimated fee upon agreement of initial design: \u00a3Deposit Fee\r\n\r\nRemainder of fee payable not more than 14 days after receipt of finished product: \u00a3Remainder of Fee\r\n\r\nInterest accrued if payment is more than 14 days late is 5% of outstanding amount to be added every 7 days, starting from 15th day after receipt of finished product.\r\n\r\nBut where is all the horrible small print? \r\n\r\nJust like a parking ticket, you cannot transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place. \r\n\r\nAlthough the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of English courts.\r\n\r\nEveryone should sign above and keep a copy for their own records.","meta":"d590a233f6443b0a0825a99d30d43a52","hash":"91101af3ffe5bac4f312a797a8320691","time":"2013-01-17T15:48:37Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"design web work contracts documents useful development freelance"},

The first contact between indigenous civilizations of Mesoamerica and Europeans took place during his reign, and he was killed during the initial stages of the Spanish conquest of Mexico, when Conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and his men fought to escape from the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan.\r\n\r\nDuring his reign the Aztec Empire reached its maximal size. Through warfare, Moctezuma expanded the territory as far south as Xoconosco in Chiapas and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and incorporated the Zapotec and Yopi people into the empire. He changed the previous meritocratic system of social hierarchy and widened the divide between pipiltin (nobles) and macehualtin (commoners) by prohibiting commoners from working in the royal palaces.\r\n\r\nThe portrayal of Moctezuma in history has mostly been colored by his role as ruler of a defeated nation, and many sources describe him as weak-willed and indecisive.

But after a while I came to the conclusion: maybe yes. Given the amount of time living creatures devote to food and its attendant states\u2014food! the stuff that sustains us\u2014I decided that, yes, there might be something crucial about the necessities of eating and eliminating that defines us. How much of our state of being is dependent upon being hungry, eating, having eaten, being full, shitting. Hunger! Our word for everything from nourishment to passionate desire. Satisfied! Meaning everything from well-fed to sexually fulfilled to mentally soothed. Shit! Our word for human waste and our expletive of impatience. The more I thought about it, the more I decided that there are huge swaths of existence that would be impenetrable- indescribable, unprogrammable, utterly unable to be represented\u2014to a creature that did not eat or shit.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nAI researchers who are looking at social life are certainly on the right path in the search to understand sentience. But until they grasp the centrality of identity, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll find what they\u2019re looking for. And then, of course, even supposing they grant that there is something called an identity, a unique constellation of body and experience that somehow makes a creature a someone, a self\u2014even then, they\u2019ll still have to find a way to program it.\r\n\r\nTheir task in simulating a self-identifying sentient creature will be a little like trying to simulate a hurricane. Think about how weather simulations work. Unable to take into account all of the complexity that goes into the production of weather (the whole world, essentially), simulations use some subset of that complexity and are able to do a fairly good job of predicting what will happen in the next hours or days. But as you move out in time, or at the extremes of weather, the model breaks down. After three days, the predictions begin to fail; after ten, the simulation no longer works at all. The fiercer the storm, the less useful the simulation. Hurricanes are not something you predict; they\u2019re something you watch. And that is what human sentience is: a hurricane\u2014too complex to understand fully by rational means, something we observe, marvel at, fear. In the end we give up and call it an \u201cact of God.\u201d\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nthere's so much in here I could quote. worth a future re-read.","meta":"579a49c38516509ffd184df9d4aec060","hash":"95cefa223903fe065324526b41c5b26c","time":"2013-01-15T17:49:22Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"intelligence AI programming future robotics"},

However, there are some important distinctions. First, WordNet interlinks not just word forms\u2014strings of letters\u2014but specific senses of words. As a result, words that are found in close proximity to one another in the network are semantically disambiguated. Second, WordNet labels the semantic relations among words, whereas the groupings of words in a thesaurus does not follow any explicit pattern other than meaning similarity.","meta":"b8d17645c849ba1f548d96f09a54d45a","hash":"cfc685f49840fce71808b38f4efa50ce","time":"2013-01-14T22:45:11Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"dictionary english language linguistics reference thesaurus"},

It stands almost three times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. Olympus Mons is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Amazonian Period. Olympus Mons had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \"Olympic Snow\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain.","meta":"8eadd824aab2cb30c072584bd6f4ef17","hash":"bf671b9e472d9667ff1dd2762f8922a9","time":"2013-01-14T03:51:39Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"space mars mountains rad tallest"},

While not yet a continuous trail, relying on road walks in some areas, it nevertheless takes in many of the popular hiking attractions west of the Hudson River, such as the New Jersey Palisades, Harriman State Park, the Shawangunk Ridge and the Catskill Mountains. It offers hikers a diversity of environments to pass through, from suburbia and sea-level salt marshes along the Hudson to wilderness and boreal forest on Catskill summits 4,000 feet (1219 m) in elevation.\r\n\r\nWhen conceived in the 1930s, it was to be the antithesis of a hiking trail, with neither a designated route nor blazes, simply a list of points of interest hikers could find their own routes to. However, increasing development after World War II in Orange and Rockland counties made that less workable, and it was revived in the 1960s as a standard trail. Plans call for it to be extended through the Adirondacks to the Canadian border.","meta":"d52e8764cea6b580ec7cf1fd01620ef4","hash":"7dd65ca43afd265859c0f7ddb29fd1be","time":"2013-01-14T03:04:35Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"hiking newyork longdistance"},

You answer it, and then they ask, \u201cWho Cares?\u201d, and when you answer THAT , they ask, \u201cso what?\u201d. When you have finished imagining this chain, you usually have a much more powerful and motivating reason (or, you realize there IS no compelling reason or use case because you could not come up with answers for all three challenges). We now suggest that technical authors constantly run through the who-who cares-so what when writing, and it works quite powerfully for those writing marketing copy as well. Way too often, people stop at the first why (or sooner), but that thing they finally say in exasperation with the final \u201cso?\u201d yeah, THAT \u2019s where you get to the meaty core of the why, and usually it\u2019s more motivating and powerful. Regardless, it\u2019s surprising how little the true \u201cwhy\u201d is even given a nod whether in technical docs or marketing.

The proliferation of printing technology meant that \u201can increasing number of readers became writers\u201d\u2014in publications\u2019 letters-to-the-editor sections and in pamphlets (and, much later, in zines and blogs). Benjamin concluded that \u201cthe distinction between author and public is about to lose its basic character.\u201d He made similar predictions about film and music.\r\n\r\nAlthough he made his living as a writer, Benjamin embraced this increasing participation of the masses in art-making (and his hopes for film may be realized in our lifetimes). He thought that active engagement by as many people as possible was good for society, and made for better art. Time and again, he disparaged artists who sought to protect their privileged social spaces, whose politics never went beyond sympathy to an actual practice of engagement with the public.\r\n\r\nBut Benjamin was optimistic about automated cultural production because he connected it to particular types of social transformation. He believed the massification of artistic production would mean the proletarianization of artists. As more people made art, artists would find themselves a part of the masses, without a specialized \u201cposition between the classes.\u201d Artistic production, steeped in a radical mass movement, would more authentically represent the aims of the working class and integrate with political praxis instead of just political ideology. To borrow Bourriaud\u2019s distinction, art would exist for use rather than contemplation. Benjamin, who wanted to \u201csupersede the opposition between musicians and listeners,\u201d would have loved a world where everyone screws and chops.","meta":"753389e122a83835575404c556a6b889","hash":"ba128baaed076e7e7b68d5484bb68eb8","time":"2013-01-11T18:26:26Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"music future technology benjamin screw dj"},

We Don't Need \u2019Em! | Smashing Mobile","extended":"Let\u2019s look at a typical scenario of loading a Web page, shall we?\r\n\r\n1. Initial HTML page is downloaded\r\nDuring this phase, most of the time, the browser downloads the initial HTML page on a new TCP connection. That new TCP connection needs to be careful not to send more data than the physical link can handle, so it uses its slow-start mechanism. This means that, during this phase, if the browser needs to measure the effective bandwidth it\u2019s got, it will significantly underestimate the available bandwidth. When we\u2019re discussing bandwidth media queries, this phase is the critical one. When the browser needs to decide which resources to download according to the media query, this measurement is most likely the only bandwidth measurement that the browser will have with this particular server.\r\n\r\n2. CSS and JavaScript external resources are loaded.\r\nDuring this phase, the browser has a collection of new TCP connections, all in their slow-start phase, and they are not all necessarily to the same destination server. Again, estimating bandwidth in this phase is not straightforward.\r\n\r\n3. Images are loaded.\r\nHere the browser has multiple connections, each one downloading a resource. The problem is that these connections are not always in the same phase of their life cycle. Some might be in the slow-start phase; some may have suffered a packet loss and, thus, reduced their window and the bandwidth they are trying to fill; and some might be warmed-up TCP connections, ready to fill the bandwidth. These TCP connections are not necessarily all to the same destination server, and the bandwidth towards the various destination servers might be different between one another.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nWeb developers should be able to define image resources of various resolutions, which would later be used by the browser to perform heuristic optimizations. This can be done by a declarative syntax, similar to the syntax of the srcset responsive images proposal. The syntax would define various resources and would hint to the browser which images to use for various criteria, such as screen density and screen size. The browser would then use these hints, but with room left open for further optimizations (related to bandwidth, user preference, data plan costs, you name it).\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nMedia queries are necessary when the browser must not be allowed to use heuristics to pick the right image resource to present. One of the best examples of this (and an illustration of one of the biggest shortcomings of the srcset proposal) is the art direction use case. This is the use case where the proposed picture element really shines.","meta":"3198c6763b05304b14ac78dd88217141","hash":"c05750ab2d9f64526661295185ef6667","time":"2013-01-09T15:53:11Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"responsive mediaqueries images development"},

On maps that are not of streets, other \"copyright trap\" features (such as nonexistent towns or mountains with the wrong elevations) may be inserted or altered for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nTrap streets are often nonexistent streets; but sometimes, rather than actually depicting a street where none exists, a map will misrepresent the nature of a street in a fashion that can still be used to detect copyright violators but is less likely to interfere with navigation. For instance, a map might add nonexistent bends to a street, or depict a major street as a narrow lane, without changing its location or its connections to other streets.\r\n\r\nTrap streets are routinely denied and rarely acknowledged by publishers. This is not always the case, however. A popular driver's atlas for the city of Athens, Greece, warns inside its front cover that potential copyright violators should beware of trap streets.","meta":"27d7fb7d101bf13ecbeaecf8c16056ea","hash":"2ebf0fb7f5958918ef1fabd11315692e","time":"2013-01-03T20:43:08Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"copyright maps wikipedia"},

{"href":"http:\/\/basecase.org\/2012\/12\/fractals-and-stories\/","description":"Fractals and Stories","extended":"Every part of the shore between the Mandelbrot Set and its surroundings has its own version of the universal bulb pattern. The regions have names like Elephant Valley, Double Scepter Valley, and Triple Spiral Valley.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re in Seahorse Valley.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to branches. Nature is full of branches because if you want to be close to a lot of space with minimal increase in your own volume, your best bet is a structure that forks and sub-forks. This is how birds make wings: they send out a bone with a little quick tissue and feather roots, and from them grow rachis, and from them grow barbs, and from them grow barbules, and from them grow barbicels, between which the gaps are so small that air doesn\u2019t bother trying to get through, and the bird has made something the shape of an airfoil without having to fill it with heavy meat. Branching is also how plants fill out their space in the air to collect sunlight and CO2, and underground to find solid nutrients. The structures of your nervous, respiratory, and circulatory systems are similarly manifold.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nFluid dynamicists use the phrase viscous fingering to describe this kind of structure in their domain.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nA sterotype was a block of type fused solid \u2013 a backtrack from movable type for the sake of convenience. A newspaper might have a stereotype for the or the name of its town; a jobbing printer might make a stereotype of a client\u2019s business card so it would wear longer without requiring resetting. (There was another word for this kind of object, from French onomatopoeia: clich\u00e9.)\r\n\r\nUtilities like TextExpander and autocomplete serve a purpose very much like that of stereotypes.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nPeople who do not use mass production for their decoration often use roughly space-filling curves: patterns that can be elaborated until they cover their base fabric. It is neither necessary nor sufficient I encourage someone else to write their own speculative nonfiction about why this is. I suspect that William Morris, studies of time use, and a diagram of a loom will feature heavily. to be away from contemporary Western technology to embroider \u2013 or paint, or engrave \u2013 manifold branches on things, but the correlation seems strong.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nIf no one had heard of the Odyssey, and you tried to publish it today as fiction set in the world of the Greek myths, your editor would probably praise many parts highly, then gently outline some concerns. For starters, it\u2019s about as structured as a handful of sand. Theoretically, the hero is driven by his desire to get home, but this only affects him at random and rarely in interesting ways. For the most part, he\u2019s having entertaining but arbitrary adventures among supporting characters we never get to know. There\u2019s little because \u2026 and so \u2026 but finally and a whole lot of and then \u2026 and then \u2026 and then. \r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe areas with the richest remaining traditions tended to be those with the least state power and the lowest literacy, due to poverty or war. Murko was very explicit that the stories were not fixed things.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nVarious scholars had realized around 1900\u20131930 that the peculiarities of the Homeric poems were explained perfectly by seeing them as records of a living oral tradition. The repeated images were formulas that the singer, in the moment of singing, knew would bridge a gap in the meter or narrative. The poet had not memorized the text of the poem (because there was no such thing), only its vital shapes and a huge collection of words and techniques for recreating at the pace of speech.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nIn the eastern United States, for example \u2013 a lot of what we know about certain oral traditions among slaves comes from right at their end, when they overlapped with writing for a single generation. There was a song that newly ex-slaves composed and recomposed about ambivalence toward death in a time of nominal freedom but great suffering, for example, that was recorded in several quite different versions and we now know as Michael, Row the Boat Ashore. \r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nOne of the most studied of these formulas is the Hero on the Beach, in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. It is a moment in which the protagonist stands on a beach, surrounded by companions, in the presence of a light, and begins a journey.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe poet Gary Snyder did his undergrad thesis on a Haida story called He Who Hunted Birds in His Father\u2019s Village, which various people had pointed out was startlingly parallel to the swan-maiden folktale of Central Europe. In fact these both belong to a category of animal wife stories that vary by region \u2013 seals in Northern Europe, cranes in East Asia, buffalo in Central Africa, and so on. I assume that if we could say what these stories mean, if it were as simple as young men coming to terms with the otherness of women or something, we would already have spelled it out and wouldn\u2019t need all the different stories.\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nman this is just so damn good","meta":"2f60edc110589ee1fa03ac960eb3825e","hash":"671dfcfb484c7ac9dc041913190f5214","time":"2013-01-03T06:36:14Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"math writing rad nature fractal literature history publishing"},

For thousands of years, the tree appeared in a stunted shrub formation (also known as a krummholz formation) due to the harsh extremes of the environment in which it lives. During the warming of the last century, the tree has sprouted into a normal tree formation. The man who discovered the tree, Leif Kullman (Professor of Physical Geography at Ume\u00e5 University), has attributed this growth spurt to global warming, and given the tree its nickname \"Old Tjikko\" after his late dog.","meta":"88549aa90698a47dd2397cab5d65abfe","hash":"af2c8bac44ad6731b301b77d52bb24d6","time":"2012-12-20T17:01:13Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"trees nature rad old sweden wikipedia"},

It helps communicate the meaning behind your code rather than the algorithm. I already know the array iteration algorithm, thank you very much. Stop repeating it and just tell me what you are trying to do.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nJavaScript's object model is not enough.

The book portrays the political situation of Europe in the later Viking Age, Andalusia under Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir, Denmark under Harold Bluetooth, followed by the struggle between Eric the Victorious and Sweyn Forkbeard, Ireland under Brian Boru, England under Ethelred the Unready, and the Battle of Maldon, all before the backdrop of the gradual Christianisation of Scandinavia, contrasting the pragmatic Norse pagan outlook with the exclusiveness of Islam and Christianity. The novel is divided into two parts, published in 1941 and 1945, with two books each.","meta":"574bd1307625e6d68266bcec6e94dbd0","hash":"1c76fa26f941ef255f46f512ede1ccab","time":"2012-12-14T15:35:03Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"books sweden vikings wikipedia saga"},

It\u2019s an attempt to freeze the system, to declare it complete and contained, an automaton, but this is anti-network, and the paucity of its thinking is revealed by the network. The failure takes many forms, but it\u2019s a contextual failure. You have to include the demon in the system, you have to include the man in the box.\n\nThe New Aesthetic has been repeatedly and roundly criticised for not stating itself clearly in a way that old frameworks, artistic and academic, may get their heads around; but also for romanticising \u201crobots\u201d, a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between reifying the machine and attributing agency to the machine as paranoiac-critical method, as spatial analysis. There is no romanticisation here. Of course the gaze of the machine is our gaze too: this is what a literacy of the network attempts to articulate, this is what we are attempting to point at \u2014 from the inside.\n\nsaved via Pocket on December 04, 2012 at 04:10PM","meta":"2460a291f7f54ed1b51729ab673735a6","hash":"03e741f1411d91602df87f2d884b088b","time":"2012-12-05T14:55:58Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"ifttt via:pocket internet newaesthetic tools robotics"},

I\u2019ve spent plenty of time articulating the cognitive dissonances of electronic books: this is what is happening to everything. The cognitive dissonance of time, what some people have called atemporality, which appears as hauntology, and which I sometimes prefer to think of as simultaneity or network realism. Atemporality is not an aesthetic, its the affect of this condition.\n\nEverything constructed, building towards this point. Everything undermined, ready to pull it all down as soon as the moment is upon us. Like those old Quaker meeting houses with the single point, the central pin, which when removed would collapse the house and thus remove the grounds for prosecution under unlawful assembly acts. Or the business of setting up meeting houses at a crossroad, so the congregation could call from window to window, hold a service in common without violating the same laws.\n\nsaved via Pocket on December 03, 2012 at 01:46PM","meta":"5e4f413b29498945f1e13cba50c73611","hash":"1dea798bc1f61772a0e5ed89086d56ba","time":"2012-12-05T14:55:56Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"ifttt via:pocket art internet landart newaesthetic"},

Someone who's just been signed.\r\n\r\n49. Someone who's already been dropped. \r\n\r\n48. Rapper who has done things that would make Chris Brown cut off his dick in shame, but because they're not to anyone famous, they still count towards his grizzled street cred with Pitchfork readers who are too scared and confused by WSHH to get their news from source.\r\n\r\n47. Whatever Thom Yorke has blessed this year.\r\n\r\n46. \"Never heard of it.\"\r\n\r\n45. \"I've heard of it, but not actually gotten around to hearing it yet.\"\r\n\r\n44. \"Worst thing I've ever heard.\"\r\n\r\n43. Kendrick Lamar.\r\n\r\n42. Band who mistakenly believed they'd be given a big post-Olympics popularity boost by their very public decision to tell Danny Boyle and his Opening Ceremony to go fuck themselves.\r\n\r\n41. Artist whose raw public confession of homosexuality wasn't quite as good as Frank Ocean's because he had the misfortune not to work in a genre that hates gays.\r\n\r\n40. Peaking Lights\r\n\r\n39. Woman compared to Kate Bush because of key overlaps: 1) being a woman, 2) singing, 3) giving the impression that she has difficulty coping with life.\r\n\r\n38. Woman praised in copy for \"striking a blow for modern femininity\", a blow that so far consists of making mediocre indie-pop about past boyfriends.\r\n\r\n37. Mac DeMarco\r\n\r\n36. Album that everyone suddenly seems to be talking about like they've been into it for ages, despite the fact that you've never heard anyone other than the Quietus say a damned word about it, and never will again after 31 December.\r\n\r\n35 \u2013 31. Five acts who have all slept with someone who has slept with Swim Deep.\r\n\r\n30. People voting for Django Django who meant to vote for Alt-J.\r\n\r\n29. People voting for Alt-J who meant to vote for Django Django.\r\n\r\n28. Act who changed name and moved to Montreal to make deep house two years after changing name and moving to Brooklyn to make witch garage two years after moving to Portland to make Apple advert indie.\r\n\r\n27. Band who had the good fortune to be alphabetised in everyone's iTunes immediately after Grimes, leading to crucial \"left it running\" plays.\r\n\r\n26. The much-feted return of a \"living legend\" who, despite enjoying a good feting, has mainly spent the past few months praying that no one finds out what happened in his Top Of The Pops dressing room in March 1973.\r\n\r\n25. A \"shadowy\" post-dubstep producer, who spends his days cold-calling pensioners on behalf of EDF Energy.\r\n\r\n24. Artist whom music journalists have decided to love because their former career as a journalist means that there's still hope for everyone's thwarted and stalled creative ambitions, #GodGetMeOutOfThisWakingNightmare.\r\n\r\n23. Something on Not Not Fun that was recorded in a pristine, state of the art studio \u2013 in which the band were playing next door in the bogs for that authentic lo-fi sound.\r\n\r\n22. Someone who might have been in Odd Future, but trying to deny it now.\r\n\r\n21. Canadians making Canadian Music.\r\n\r\n20. Toy\r\n\r\n19. A bunch of super-smart, snot-nosed, wet behind the balls students whose lyrics seem to infer that they have had sexual intercourse, whereas one listen to the way they sing them confirms that they surely haven't.\r\n\r\n18. Album that writer breathlessly describes as having \"deconstructed pop\", but which simply reflects the fact that said writer doesn't listen to much pop nowadays and is astonished at genre-blending that anyone with a working knowledge of Radio 1 will have long since taken as standard.\r\n\r\n17. Beach House\r\n\r\n16. Someone who once shared a cab with Kevin Parker.\r\n\r\n15. Band who have released an \"amusingly arch\" record that they'd be mortified to hear described as such, because in fact they were being deadly serious and are just incredibly pretentious.\r\n\r\n14. Bob Dylan or Leonard Cohen\r\n\r\n13. Fiona Apple or Cat Power\r\n\r\n12. Dirty Projectors or David Byrne\r\n\r\n11. \"Sun-dappled dream-popper\" who in truth only ever dreams about killing animals with a spade.\r\n\r\n10. The xx or Chromatics\r\n\r\n9. Album whose appraisal involved the editor having to do a ctrl+F to make damn sure she'd rooted out every last appearance of the word \"shimmering\".\r\n\r\n8. Space reserved for old black legend being rebooted for modern coffee tables by Richard Russell.\r\n\r\n7 \u2013 2. The six highest-ranking albums of the year on Pitchfork that lazy hacks swotted up on to obscure the fact that they basically spent 2012 listening to nothing but real music, i.e. Muse and The Vaccines.\r\n\r\n1. Album Of The Year: Mumfords (Q), Kendrick Lamar Spector (NME), Sven Vath (Mixmag), Andy Stott (Resident Advisor), Neil Young (Uncut), Neil Young (Mojo), Neil Young (Classic Rock), Neil Young (Home & Garden), people humming transcendentally over distorted tape loops of concrete being laid (The Wire).","meta":"1314ada7a79a1e7f4710ca39b3872538","hash":"2e91fdaa72adc279e14dac90e02c3a48","time":"2012-12-03T15:06:39Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"lol records list 2012"},

{"href":"http:\/\/www.ecma-international.org\/ecma-262\/5.1\/","description":"ECMAScript Language Specification - ECMA-262 Edition 5.1","extended":"This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company\u2019s Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.\r\n\r\nThe development of this Standard started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.\r\n\r\nThat Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO\/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO\/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO\/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in nature.\r\n\r\nThe third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try\/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of forthcoming internationalisation facilities and future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO\/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002.\r\n\r\nSince publication of the third edition, ECMAScript has achieved massive adoption in conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become the programming language that is supported by essentially all web browsers. Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. Although that work was not completed and not published as the fourth edition of ECMAScript, it informs continuing evolution of the language. The fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5th edition) codifies de facto interpretations of the language specification that have become common among browser implementations and adds support for new features that have emerged since the publication of the third edition. Such features include accessor properties, reflective creation and inspection of objects, program control of property attributes, additional array manipulation functions, support for the JSON object encoding format, and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security.\r\n\r\nThis present edition 5.1 of the ECMAScript Standard is fully aligned with third edition of the international standard ISO\/IEC 16262:2011.\r\n\r\nECMAScript is a vibrant language and the evolution of the language is not complete. Significant technical enhancement will continue with future editions of this specification.\r\n\r\nThis Ecma Standard has been adopted by the General Assembly of June 2011.","meta":"11ff8abf465a156ff3f075f3e4a05f03","hash":"bdcb52046481fe60c89c67b042b35391","time":"2012-11-27T15:33:27Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"spec documentation javascript"},

Bake without stirring until the vegetables and apples are wrinkled, slightly brown, and the edges of the squash are beginning to crisp, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare the walnuts.\r\n\r\n2\r\nFor the walnuts: Place a deep fryer or high-sided saucepan over high heat, and add vegetable or canola oil to come no closer than 3 inches from the top of the pot; when the walnuts are added, the oil will bubble and rise. Heat to 375\u00b0F. If using a saucepan, reduce the heat to very low to hold the temperature.\r\n\r\n3\r\nIn a medium pot over high heat, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the walnuts and boil for 10 seconds. Drain well and immediately toss with the confectioners\u2019 sugar. Spread flat on a baking sheet and allow to dry for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n4\r\nHave a baking sheet lined with paper towels nearby. Confirm that the temperature of the oil is 375\u00b0F, adjusting as needed. Working in batches if necessary, add the walnuts and stir once or twice. Fry until amber-brown, about 30 seconds. Using a wire skimmer or heatproof slotted spoon, remove from the oil and transfer to paper towels. Sprinkle lightly with salt and allow to cool for 5 minutes before handling. May be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.\r\n\r\n5\r\nTo serve: Remove the vegetables from the oven, drizzle with maple syrup, and sprinkle with 2 to 3 tablespoons of halved or roughly crumbled walnut pieces. Serve with walnut bread, if desired.","meta":"11e457b468fee3e52894bc0c843b7785","hash":"651dd70ef39cfd0d3d49a99e502e5afb","time":"2012-11-22T15:58:34Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"food fall recipes vegetables"},

A booming economy, government housing initiatives, infrastructure programs, and private real estate speculation have all driven construction to record levels. New apartment, office, and government buildings regularly rise up over older neighborhoods, and thousands have relocated to modern housing complexes. The blend of old and new Chinese architecture is ever-present in cities and villages, as older buildings are torn down and newer ones built at ever faster rates.

(James\u2019s thesis that this obliviousness correlates to a sense of special entitlement is corroborated by my own observation that the crowd on Amtrak, where airline-level fares act as a de facto class barrier, is generally louder and more inconsiderate than the supposed riffraff on the bus.) It\u2019s a pathology that seems increasingly common, I suspect in part because people now spend so much time in the solipsist\u2019s paradise of the Internet that they carry its illusion of invisible (and inaudible) omniscience back with them out into the real world.\n\nsaved via Pocket on November 19, 2012 at 12:26PM","meta":"a919c5490cba306f8c652768bace9057","hash":"51054be894fbda45136d5fa89d52c3e0","time":"2012-11-21T19:03:07Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"quiet sound travel ifttt via:pocket"},

Think The Sims on super-duper steroids. These cultures, Bostrom reasoned, might then create ancestor simulations on their computers, meaning simulations of their own past. With these ideas in mind, Bostrom then made the final leap by considering the truth, or falsehood, of three statements:\n\nAlmost all civilizations at our level of development become extinct before becoming technologically mature.\nThe fraction of technologically mature civilizations that are interested in creating ancestor simulations is almost zero. \u2028\nYou are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.\nSo watch what happens as we run down the truth\/falsehood list of these statements. If 1 is true then virtually no civilization becomes super-high tech before dying, which kind of stinks. If 1 is false but 2 is true, then virtually no ancestor simulations should exist. The use of \"virtually\" is important here because Bostrom's purely philosophical argument relies on probabilities and, in the end, it leads him to a remarkable place.\n\nNow let's say statement 1 is false. That would means there are civilizations reaching heights of technology we can barely imagine today. Then add statement 2 as false. That would mean some of these technologically mature civilizations start creating super-duper simulations of their own past. With statement 1 and statement 2 false the conclusion has to be that there must exist ancestor simulations running out there right now full of simulated ancestor minds.\n\nsaved via Pocket on November 20, 2012 at 10:27PM","meta":"57fad1d163023d94ae9106c079f54f2c","hash":"4b2521a3b7f1bbd379024d8e7facefa8","time":"2012-11-21T03:45:15Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"computers scifi reality philosophy NPR ifttt via:pocket"},

The Module Pattern\r\n\r\nI find myself using the module pattern more often these days. The logic is shielded from the global scope by a function wrapper (usually self-invoking) which returns an object representing the module\u2019s public interface. By immediately invoking the function and assigning the result to a namespace variable, we lock up the module\u2019s API in the namespace. Additionally any variables not included in the return value will remain forever private, visible only to the public functions that reference them.\r\n\r\nLike the object literal example above, the receiving namespace can be easily switched, but there are added advantages: object literal notation is rigid \u2013 its all about property assignments, with no room for supporting logic. Moreover all properties must be initialized and property values cannot easily cross reference one another (so, for example, internal closures are not possible). The module pattern suffers none of these constraints and gives us the added benefit of privacy.","meta":"ceb03e6a364e191a5a367ef6dcdaba43","hash":"0a3c965dd683c56469e93c14a321ba4a","time":"2012-11-09T01:02:22Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"programming development namespacing javascript"},

I would avoid Bombay Sapphire, however; the saltiness that makes it so exquisite in a Martini does not play well with the tang of the tonic and bite of the Campari in this drink.)\r\nTonic\r\nCampari\r\nIce\r\nLime\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS\r\n1. Pour gin and tonic over ice into a highball glass. I have a heavy hand, and tend to pour a ratio of 1:1 when it comes to gin and tonic, but that does not go over well with everyone, and, come to think of it, I have never served this drink without at least one person ending up in tears, which may have something to do with the large amount of gin. Use your best judgment.\r\n\r\n2. Add a splash of Campari. How much is a splash? Generations of Balks have debated this very subject with Talmudic levels of interpretation. You will eventually find your own metric, but for now do this: Fill the cap of the Campari bottle to the top, and dump it into the drink.\r\n\r\n3. Give it one quick yet gentle stir.\r\n\r\n4. Squeeze the lime into the drink and then garnish. Always lime, never lemon. (There is a possibly apocryphal tale about a relative who once attempted to use an orange, only to be drummed out of the family, but the story has never been verified and I have never had the urge to see how such an unorthodox and disturbing idea would play out in practice. You don't mess with perfection.)\r\n\r\n5. Sit back, relax and watch your summer go by like every summer before has, borne aloft on the wings of alcohol and its boon of temporary forgetfulness. I mean, yeah, you could probably do the same thing with beer, but this is much much better. Enjoy!","meta":"e4c2e5d2a2cd3d9c3d68e1e6ca795fcb","hash":"38af75b7db91455da0a479e3a55d46b9","time":"2012-06-08T20:30:05Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"drinks recipes gin"},

Add 4 tablespoons butter and the lard, and use your fingers to gently rub the fat into the flour until it has the texture of coarse bread crumbs.\r\n2.\r\nMix in just enough ice water to bind the mixture, about 3 tablespoons, and lightly knead the dough until well combined and smooth. When you can mold the mixture into a ball, do so. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes &amp;mdash; or freeze for 10 &amp;mdash; to ease rolling.\r\n3.\r\nHeat the oven to 350. Add 2 tablespoons butter to a large skillet over low heat. When the butter melts, add the onions, a pinch of salt and the ground white pepper; cook slowly for about 10 minutes, never browning.\r\n4.\r\nTurn the heat to medium and slowly pour in the water. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid cooks off, about 10 minutes. Remove the onions from the pan and place them on a plate to cool\r\n5.\r\nGrease the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish and sprinkle a countertop with flour. Unwrap the dough and divide it into two balls, one twice as big as the other. Put them on the surface and sprinkle the tops with flour. Using light pressure, roll each one from the center outward, adding more flour as needed and turning them over once or twice during the process. When the larger ball is roughly 10 inches in diameter, gently move it into the pie dish and press it firmly into the bottom and sides. Prick it all over with a fork.\r\n6.\r\nLayer the onions and cheese on top of the dough in the dish, then carefully cover with the remaining dough &amp;mdash; it should be about 8 inches in diameter. Press the edges together, gently but firmly, and brush the top and edges with milk. Use a knife to make 3 small incisions in the top of the crust so steam can escape.\r\n7.\r\nPlace the pie on a baking sheet and bake until the crust is nicely browned and the insides are bubbly, 45 minutes to an hour. Cool a bit before slicing into wedges and serving.\r\nYIELD 4 to 6 servings.","meta":"a82afafe78171dd67101384863768c87","hash":"e698e52d2a479b5c5d9a1fef3bc0a3b0","time":"2012-06-07T20:49:19Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"nytimes recipes cheese pie bittman"},

{"href":"http:\/\/www.americastestkitchenfeed.com\/recipes\/homemade-cold-brew-coffee\/#","description":"Homemade Cold-Brew Coffee | The Feed","extended":"Makes about 2 cups of coffee concentrate\r\n\r\nI like to make cold-brew with a medium roast, as I find it tastes more like coffee and less like the roasting process than dark or French roast. Light roasts tend to be too acidic. As with any kind of coffee brewing, it\u2019s best to grind the beans yourself just before using them. The ratio of water to coffee is 1:1 by volume and roughly 4:1 by weight, so feel free to scale the recipe to suit your needs. If you don\u2019t have a French press you can make the coffee in a pitcher and strain it through a fine-mesh strainer, and finally through a coffee filter, as in step 2.\r\n\r\n3\u00bd cups finely ground medium roast coffee (see note)\r\nKosher salt (optional)\r\n\r\n1. Stir together coffee and 3\u00bd cups room-temperature water in large French press. Allow raft of ground coffee to form, about 10 minutes, and stir again to incorporate. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 24 hours (an hour shorter or longer is fine).\r\n\r\n2. Using French press plunger, press firmly on grinds to separate them from concentrate. Pour coffee concentrate into coffee filter-lined fine-mesh strainer set over large measuring cup. Let sit until concentrate filters through, up to 30 minutes. (You should have about 2 cups of coffee concentrate; concentrate can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days).\r\n\r\n3. Combine \u00bd cup coffee concentrate, \u00bd cup cold water, and pinch Kosher salt (if using) and pour into glass with ice. Drink.","meta":"c85db2fa0cb1ce286f2a1a053c4dc5ba","hash":"acf5a455b23dccd10a4b1c80990b4aef","time":"2012-05-26T21:39:09Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"coffee recipes coldbrew food drinks"},

Place them in a blender with the cayenne peppers. Add 2 tbsp. of mineral oil, 2 cups hot water and 3 tsp. of natural liquid soap. Place the lid on the blender and process on high speed for two to three minutes, or until pureed. Allow the hot pepper spray mixture to stand overnight, which will increase the heat and effectiveness of the solution.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, put on a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands. This mixture can irritate the skin, so be careful while handling. Strain the liquid through a piece of cheesecloth (or nylon pantyhose) into a glass pint-sized canning jar. Secure the lid tightly and store in a cool, dry place for up to 90 days.\r\n\r\nUsing Hot Pepper Spray\r\nTo use, measure 1\/4 cup of the mixture and transfer to a clean spray bottle. Add about 5 cups of water and shake well to combine. Spray directly onto plants as necessary, being careful not to get any of the liquid on your skin. It's a good idea to wear gloves any time you are handling the hot pepper spray. You can make a larger batch to use in a garden sprayer for larger pest problems. Just stick to the formula above of 1\/4 cup of solution to every five cups of water.","meta":"0d245e9b011e629012329e240a696402","hash":"f7573e811a759dd826e2192f0e05f618","time":"2012-05-21T20:07:31Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"gardening pests insects diy"},

These fields include astrophysics, which has revealed how planets and stars form, interact and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales, and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia.\r\n\r\nAll predictions of the future of the Earth, the Solar System and the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time. Stars must eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out; close encounters will gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies. Eventually, matter itself will come under the influence of radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. However, as current data suggest that the Universe is flat, and thus will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, the infinite future potentially allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of a Boltzmann brain.\r\n\r\nThese timelines cover events from roughly eight thousand years from now to the farthest reaches of future time. A number of alternate future events are listed to account for questions still unresolved, such as whether humans survive, whether protons decay or whether the Earth will be destroyed by the Sun's expansion into a red giant.","meta":"40ff8a15320192da0c5c59af70ef667f","hash":"bd74ca8c1827a94584d4a1849d3b06e8","time":"2012-05-08T22:04:16Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"future physics science wikipedia rad timeline"},

Bread is a staple in my kitchen, too, but like many households we often don\u2019t finish a loaf before it becomes hard and stale. That presents an opportunity, not a problem: Mediterranean cooks long ago figured out just how much you can do with stale bread. People who have survived on little never throw out food that can be eaten.  As long as it\u2019s not moldy, bread that has dried out can be reconstituted in thick vegetable soups, pungent salads and comforting, savory bread puddings. I\u2019m particularly fond of stale bread used with tomatoes \u2014 now is a perfect time to take advantage of the last few weeks of this summer\u2019s bounty.  Choose breads that are made at least partially with whole wheat flour or other whole grains. They\u2019ll be higher in fiber and such nutrients as selenium, potassium and magnesium. Be aware that cutting hard bread is a bit dangerous; the knife can slip off the hard surface, and a serrated bread knife makes a nasty cut. If your stale bread is too hard to cut easily, douse it with water first. You can even plunge it into a bowl of water for about 20 to 30 seconds, then lift it out and squeeze gently.

Only two genera of Lumbricid earthworms are indigenous to North America while introduced genera have spread to areas where earthworms did not formerly exist, especially in the north where forest development relies on a large amount of undecayed leaf matter. When worms decompose that leaf layer, the ecology may shift making the habitat unsurvivable for certain species of trees, ferns and wildflowers. Another possible ecologic impact of greater earthworm numbers: larger earthworms (e.g. the night crawler, Lumbricus terrestris, and the Alabama jumper, Amynthas agrestis) can be eaten by adult salamanders, and when the salamanders do consume the earthworms they are more successful at reproduction. However, those earthworms are too large for juvenile salamanders to consume, which leads to a net loss in salamander population. Currently there is no economically feasible method for controlling invasive earthworms in forests. Earthworms normally spread slowly, but can be quickly introduced by human activities such as construction earthmoving, or by fishermen releasing bait, or by plantings.

{"href":"http:\/\/markbittman.com\/how-to-cook-everything-the-basics-brownies","description":"Brownies - How to Cook Everything: The Basics: Mark Bittman","extended":"Time: 30 to 40 minutes  \r\nMakes: 9 to 12  \r\n8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, plus a little more for greasing the pan  \r\n3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, roughly chopped  \r\n1 cup sugar  \r\n2 eggs  \r\n1\/2 cup all-purpose flour  \r\nPinch salt  \r\n1\/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, optional  \r\n\r\n1. Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Grease a square baking pan with butter or line it by overlapping 2 pieces of parchment paper or aluminum foil crosswise and grease the lining.  \r\n\r\n2. Combine the stick of butter and the chocolate in a small saucepan over very low heat, stirring occasionally. (Or microwave them in a large microwave-safe bowl on medium for 10-second intervals, stirring after each.) When the chocolate is just about melted, remove the saucepan from the heat (or bowl from the microwave) and continue to stir until the mixture is smooth.  \r\n\r\n3. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl (or use the bowl you put in the microwave) and stir in the sugar. Then beat in the eggs, one at a time. Gently stir in the flour, salt, and the vanilla if you\u2019re using it.  \r\n\r\n4. Pour and scrape the mixture into the prepared pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until just barely set in the middle. Cool on a rack until set. If you used parchment, lift it out to remove the brownies. If not, cut them in squares right in the pan. Store, covered, at room temperature, for no more than a day.  \r\n\r\nTips:  If you use parchment paper (or foil) to line the pan, leave an extra inch or two overhanging each end. When the brownies are cool, grab each flap and lift them out of the pan.  Err on the side of underbaking: An overcooked brownie is dry and cakey, while an undercooked brownie is gooey and delicious.  \r\n\r\nVariations  \r\n\r\nNutty Brownies: In Step 3, substitute 1\/4 cup finely ground hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts, or pecans (use the food processor or blender to grind them) for 1\/4 cup of the flour and add 1 cup lightly toasted, roughly chopped nuts to the batter. \r\n\r\nCocoa Brownies: After the brownies cool a bit but are still warm, put 2 tablespoons cocoa in a small strainer and shake it over the pan to dust the tops of the brownies.

The pattern is formed by a number of small rectangular pixels of color. In theory, it is a far more effective camouflage than standard uniform patterns because it mimics the dappled textures and rough boundaries found in natural settings. This is caused by how the human eye interacts with pixelated images.

{"href":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cooking\/comments\/cu6iu\/hit_me_up_with_castiron_skillet_recipes\/","description":"HOW TO COOK A STEAK : Cooking","extended":"Ingredients you need, * Kosher Salt * Pepper * Steak\r\nGarlic Butter (optional) * Stick of butter * minced garlic * herb of preference, (chives, parsley, cilantro etc)\r\nGet steak that's at least 1 inch in thickness, bring it out to room temperature an hour before you cook. Let it rest the first half, and salt the crap out of it the second half. Make sure you use kosher salt. The osmosis method makes the steak super tender and evenly flavored instead of just the outer part. Don't worry, it's not going to be too salty. When you're ready to cook, rinse the steak and pat SUPER dry. Pepper it to taste.\r\nTurn on the vent, fan and possibly open a window - it is going to get smokey.\r\nTurn the heat up on the cast iron to med-high. It's going to take a good 7-8 minutes to raise the temperature of the cast iron to desired heat level. To test the correct temperature, sprinkle some water on the iron, and if the water drops jump around instead of instantly evaporizing, then its ready. I use canola oil because it can take higher heat temps, drizzle some in, and lay the end of the steak closest to you first to avoid hot oil hitting you.\r\nGet a timer and set it to 3-4 minutes per side, depending on thickness and how well you like it done. DO NOT TOUCH in between the flips. Doing so you will lose the amazing crust.\r\nWhile you're waiting for the skillet to heat up, cut up your butter into slices or cubes. Mince some garlic and fresh herbs and mash it with the cut up butter. Add a pinch of salt if you like. When the steak is ready, plate it hot side up and scoop some butter on top and get ready for some mighty goodness.\r\nBon Apetit!

{"href":"http:\/\/www.howsweeteats.com\/2011\/10\/loaded-baked-sweet-potato-soup\/?","description":"Loaded Baked Sweet Potato Soup. | How Sweet It Is","extended":"Loaded Baked Sweet Potato Soup\r\n\r\nserves about 4, can be easily multiplied\r\n\r\n3 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed (I had 2lbs total after peeling and cubing)\r\n\r\n2 tablespoons butter\r\n\r\n1 1\/2 tablespoons flour\r\n\r\n1\/2 sweet onion, diced (about 1\/2 cup chopped)\r\n\r\n2 garlic cloves, minced\r\n\r\n2 1\/2-3 cups low-sodium vegetable stock\r\n\r\n1 1\/2-2 cups low-sodium chicken stock\r\n\r\n1\/2 cup milk\r\n\r\n1\/2 teaspoon salt\r\n\r\n1\/2 teaspoon pepper\r\n\r\n1\/4 teaspoon smoked paprika\r\n\r\nfor garnishes: bacon, mascarpone cheese, crumbled goat cheese & crispy shallots\r\n\r\nPrepare potatoes: peel and cube sweet potatoes, then add to a microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high power for about 10 minutes or until fork tender, tossing 2-3 times during cook time. If you do not want to use the microwave, throw the potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper (you can omit\/add less salt and pepper later if this is the case) and roast at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes. Using the microwave will help this soup come together in 30 minutes. Roasting the sweet potatoes adds a bit more \u201ccaramely,\u201d deep flavor.\r\n\r\nHeat a large pot over medium-high heat. Add butter and diced onions and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute more, then add flour and whisk continuously to create a roux with the onions. Cook the onion roux for about 2-3 minutes, until it starts to golden in color a bit and smell nutty. Add in stock, milk, smoked paprika and potatoes, then bring to a boil. Simmer for 15-20 minutes over medium heat, stirring often \u2013 especially scraping the bottom. The potatoes will begin to bread down at this time \u2013 if they are not as broken down as you\u2019d like, mash a bit more with a fork. Turn heat down to low and add salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings according to preference. If you\u2019d prefer a thinner soup, add more stock to thin it out. You can also throw the soup in the blender to make it super creamy.\r\n\r\nServe hot with garnishes of crumbled bacon, mascarpone cheese, goat cheese, and crisped shallots.\r\n\r\nNote: to crisp the shallots, I sliced 2 whole shallots very thinly, add a little canola oil over medium-high heat, and once hot added the shallots. I cooked them for about 2 minutes, then removed with a slotted spoon and let drain on a paper towel. So good.

Dice squash into 3\/4 inch pieces.\r\nIn a large sauce pan, combine squash, broth, cayenne, cinnamon, and salt. Cook covered over medium heat until squash is tender, about 30 minutes.\r\nTransfer 1\/3 of the squash mixture to a blender\/food processor and puree until smooth (I don't have an immersion blender... if you have one, this would be a great time to bust it out.) Repeat with remaining squash. Return squash mixture to the pan. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 10 minutes. Whisk in 1 Tbsp butter. Taste for seasoning and adjust - I thought it needed a generous pinch of salt. (To freeze: cool the soup and then divide it among 6 freezer bags and freeze flat in the freezer.)\r\nMake the walnuts: Preheat oven to 325. Rough chop walnuts and spread on a small baking sheet. Roast until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Melt 2 Tbsp butter in a small sauce pan over medium heat. When the butter begins to brown, add sage and remove from heat. Toss sage browned butter with toasted walnuts.\r\nServe: Ladle soup into individual bowls. Divide cooked ravioli between the bowls. Drizzle with molasses, top with walnuts, and sprinkle with sea salt if desired.\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nYields: 6 servings\r\n\r\nAdapted from Better Homes & Garden, Fall\/Winter 2008\r\n\r\nEstimated time: 1 hour ","meta":"06498167cd917e6909160fc36b11888f","hash":"3b107b479904b4295106645a611b6316","time":"2011-10-20T18:41:46Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"soup food recipes"},

(450g) quick oats*\r\n3 cups (750ml\/about 300g) coarsely chopped raw nuts and\/or seeds (I usually use a mixture of almonds, hazelnuts and pumpkin seeds, but use whatever tickles your fancy)\r\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\r\n1\/2 teaspoon ground cardamom\r\n1\/2 teaspoon ground mace (or nutmeg)\r\n1 cup, packed (200g) dark brown sugar\r\n1\/2 cup (115g\/1 stick) unsalted butter\r\n1\/3 cup (80ml) water\r\n1\/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\r\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\r\ndried fruit, at your discretion\r\n\r\n*if you're not familiar with the difference between quick and regular (also called 'old fashioned') rolled oats, take a look at the pictures here\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 300F\/150C. In a food processor, coffee grinder or blender, grind half the oats to a fine powder. In a large bowl, combine the whole oats, ground oats, nuts, seeds and spices. In a microwave-safe bowl (or in a saucepan over medium heat), combine the brown sugar, butter and water and heat just until the butter has melted and the mixture is bubbly. Stir the mixture together until smooth, then stir in the salt and vanilla. Pour this mixture over the oats and nuts, stirring well to coat (I usually do this with my hands). It should be uniformly moist - stir in another tablespoon or two of water if it isn't. Let stand for about ten minutes.\r\n\r\nSpread the mixture out on a large baking sheet, separating it into irregular clumps with your fingers, and allowing space between the clumps for the hot air to circulate. Slide into the middle of the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and stir, gently breaking up the mixture into small-to-medium sized clumps. Return to the oven and bake another 15 minutes or so before stirring again. Repeat the bake-and-stir until the mixture is a uniform golden brown and completely dry; this usually takes 1-1 1\/2 hours. Cool completely, then stir in any dried fruit you want to use.\r\n\r\nStore in a covered container at room temperature. Serve with milk or plain yogurt and fresh fruit as desired.","meta":"5794be034567cc214864a9fb9d0cf8d9","hash":"de19c896c86e2a6aef2a71acd0f157ef","time":"2011-05-12T04:26:16Z","shared":"yes","toread":"no","tags":"recipes food granola"},
