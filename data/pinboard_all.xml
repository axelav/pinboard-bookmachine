Everyone who’s been paying attention has known about climate change for decades now. But it turns out Exxon didn’t just “know” about climate change: it conducted some of the original research. In the nineteen-seventies and eighties, the company employed top scientists who worked side by side with university researchers and the Department of Energy, even outfitting one of the company’s tankers with special sensors and sending it on a cruise to gather CO2 readings over the ocean. By 1977, an Exxon senior scientist named James Black was, according to his own notes, able to tell the company’s management committee that there was “general scientific agreement” that what was then called the greenhouse effect was most likely caused by man-made CO2; a year later, speaking to an even wider audience inside the company, he said that research indicated that if we doubled the amount of carbon dioxide in the planet’s atmosphere, we would increase temperatures two to three degrees Celsius. That’s just about where the scientific consensus lies to this day. “Present thinking,” Black wrote in summary, “holds that man has a time window of five to ten years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;" tag="climate weather oil capitalism" hash="e6d95868817086f40324913c8c9e6428" meta="b544546b3aba239b9fbf5a2f7d941ce5"    />

would be complete immersion
in physical process,
without self-consciousness—

to be the respiration of the grass,
or ionized agitation
just above the break of a wave,
traffic in a sunflower’s thousand golden rooms.

Images of exchange,
and of untrammeled nature.
But if we’re to become part of it all,
won’t our paradise also involve

participation in being, say,
diesel fuel, the impatience of trucks
on August pavement,
weird glow of service areas

along the interstate at night?
We’ll be shiny pink egg cartons,
and the thick treads of burst tires
along the highways in Pennsylvania:

a hell we’ve made to accompany
the given: we will join
our tiresome productions,
things that want to be useless forever.

But that’s me talking. Helen 
would take the greatest pleasure
in being a scrap of paper,
if that’s what there were to experience.

Perhaps that’s why she’s a painter,
finally: to practice disappearing
into her  scrupulous attention,
an exacting rehearsal for the larger

world of things it won’t be easy to love.
Helen I think will master it, though I may not.
She has practiced a long time learning to see
I have devoted myself to affirmation,

when I should have kept my eyes on the ground." tag="poetry literature nature painting" hash="135721bba01ebf70248c488346ab3a96" meta="2e7a228fcf3967da06e399d9bcc8f2b0"    />

The most troubling numbers show up far beneath the upper echelons of higher education. Elite institutions prop up the overall average earnings of college graduates nationwide. Although earnings of college graduates continue to outpace those of non-collegians by a significant margin, at some institutions, the earnings of students 10 years after enrollment are bleak.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Department of Education calculated the percentage of students at each college who earned more than $25,000 per year, which is about what high school graduates earn. At hundreds of colleges, less than half of students met this threshold 10 years after enrolling. The list includes a raft of barber academies, cosmetology schools and for-profit colleges that often leave students with few job prospects and mountains of debt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;But some more well-known institutions weren’t far behind. At Bennington College in Vermont, over 48 percent of former students were earning less than $25,000 per year. A quarter were earning less than $10,600 per year. At Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, the median annual earnings were only $35,700. Results at the University of New Mexico were almost exactly the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The data reveals how much money students are borrowing in exchange for earnings after graduation. While U.C.L.A. and Penn State are both prestigious public research universities, recent U.C.L.A. grads leave with about 30 percent less debt, even as their predecessors are earning about 30 percent more money than counterparts at Penn State. Harvard students borrow barely a quarter of what Brandeis students take on, and earn nearly twice as much.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This absolutist view is flawed, however, because language is an art of nuance. From time to time, writers may well find illustrative value in the lightest of phrases, sentences so weightless and feathery that they scarcely even seem to exist at all. These can convey details well beyond the crude thrust of the hulking active voice, and when used strictly as ornamentation, they needn’t actually convey anything at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;As a thought experiment, let’s examine in extremely close detail a set of iterative changes that can be made to a single simple grammatical structure, turning it from a statement taken at face value into one loaded with unrealized implication. This makes for rich writing which rewards – or even demands – close scrutiny.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" tag="mcsweeneys grammar cops police language" hash="ba8744b97ea3757a111e8d048832ac5c" meta="db92f3c0137e8b2c35ec1dad6784b50e"    />

This left a complex legacy. During the Cold War, it was commonplace to draw the distinction between “totalitarian” and “free” societies by noting that only in the free ones could groups self-organize independently of the state. But many of the groups that made that argument—including the magazines on this left—were often covertly-sponsored instruments of state power, at least in part. Whether or not art and artists would have been more “revolutionary” in the absence of the CIA’s cultural work is a vexed question; what is clear is that that possibility was not a risk they were willing to run. And the magazines remain, giving off an occasional glitter amid the murk left behind by the intersection of power and self-interest. Here are seven of the best, ranked by an opaque and arbitrary combination of quality, impact, and level of CIA involvement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" tag="magazines literature government cia history europe socialism communism coldwar" hash="dbcb2a9c36288fc92bd9e9a70241eae2" meta="96713c5061ee70c698ea79331da2443e"    />

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Everything that happens in your app is an “action”. These can be caused by users, browser events, or server events. Doesn’t matter. Everything that changes something in your app does it via an “action”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;2. You have one giant state object that represents all the state in your app. These are not special Models, or Collections, it’s just friggin’ objects, arrays, and primitives. No magic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3. You write “reducers” for everything that changes state. Are you familiar with the [].reduce() method of an array? If not, go read this. But a reduce function gets a starting state, the current value and returns the new state. That’s exactly what we want to do in response to actions. We get the starting state, the current action, and we return the new state.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" tag="development javascript react redux" hash="fa64518461e06a8575645778acca1f60" meta="63f3533e0aa8491a16dbbdf32bc97c4c"    />

According to the 2014 Housing and Vacancy Survey, of the city’s 2.2 million rental units, forty-seven percent are rent stabilized and 1.2 percent are rent controlled. “Rent control” is the older of the two programs, and generally applies to apartments in one- or two-family buildings built before 1947. (Rent-controlled apartments can only be bequeathed to family members who were living in the unit for two years before the original tenant vacates it.) “Rent stabilization” generally applies to apartments in buildings, built between 1947 and 1974, comprising six or more units. Both limit the amount by which landlords can increase tenants’ rent when renewing leases; however, rents in rent-regulated apartments can still be increased incrementally over time and eventually, once they hit twenty-five hundred dollars per month—and a tenant vacates the apartment—they become “deregulated,” and can be listed at market prices. (This threshold was raised from two thousand dollars per month in 2011, the last time rent regulation laws were re-negotiated.) This is called vacancy decontrol.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" tag="rent nyc housing politics" hash="72660ab572b2d812a8caf7bb876e5db8" meta="d0f864f4619f9f54acf649a4f2055fd8"    />

Its freshwater wells were overpumped, frequently contaminated by brackish water or sewage. A cholera outbreak in 1832 drove the affluent out of the city; left behind were immigrants and blacks, 3,500 of whom died, 2 percent of the city’s population.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;John Jervis, an engineer, came to the rescue. He designed and built, with immigrant labor, a dam on the Croton River in Westchester County, and then sent the water south solely on gravity. It traveled 40 gently sloping miles through mains that dropped 13.25 inches every mile, pure, unfiltered water rolling stanza by stanza through a poem of civil engineering.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It crossed from the mainland over the Harlem River at the High Bridge and continued to two reservoirs, including one built on what is now the site of the main public library. Croton water reached a fountain in City Hall Park and rose 50 feet, unpumped: gravity’s geyser. The city grew tenfold in the 19th century and, following the Jervis plans, more water was brought from upstate into the city.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For mid-19th-century New Yorkers, the High Bridge was in the country and a weekend destination that was a ferry ride away. “They came by the thousands on Sundays,” said Sidney Hornstein, a geologist and historian of the city.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;North of the High Bridge, wealthy men raced their horse-drawn carriages on the Harlem River Speedway, built for their enjoyment. Alongside the speedway, at the river’s edge, a sidewalk was built for the public at the insistence of Paul Dana, president of the parks department in 1890, who pleaded that the resource of a public park could not be squandered by not giving people a chance to get to the water.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" tag="water history nytimes nyc manhattan bronx" hash="529173d382f2a61f1afd827ebbbdd661" meta="d1aaf806cbd606d71d28d6bc93df1964"    />

An airplane typically navigates through sky countries along a route composed of a few radio beacons and many waypoints. Waypoints are defined by coordinates or their bearing and distance from a beacon, and by a name, which typically takes the form of a five-letter capitalized word — EVUKI, JETSA, SABER — that’s pronounceable and distinct to controllers and pilots regardless of their first language. Waypoint names are the sky’s audible currency of place, atomized and distinct.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many waypoint names are random, but others are not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Near the border of India and Pakistan is TIGER. Another TIGER forms part of an arrival pattern for London, as if lifted from Britain’s former empire as incongruously as an animal taken from a warm place to a zoo in a cold city.

- 3 pounds (more Or Less) Unpeeled Shrimp (21-26 Count Or Larger)
- 1/2 cup Olive Oil
- Salt And Pepper, to taste
- 3 whole Lemons (juice Of)
- 1/4 cup (to 1/2 Cup) Worcestershire Sauce
- Tabasco
- 1 stick Butter

Preparation

First, thoroughly rinse raw shrimp w/shells still on. I use 21-26 count (that means 21-26 shrimp per pound) but I’ve certainly used bigger. Any smaller than this, and it’s difficult to peel, so stick with 21-26 or bigger. Place the shrimp in a large baking pan in a single layer. Over top of the shrimp drizzle about ½ cup of extra virgin olive oil.
Generously sprinkle black pepper over top of the shrimp. Be very generous! Now sprinkle generously with salt (I use kosher).
Squeeze the juice of about 3-4 lemons over top of all of the shrimp. Now GENEROUSLY drizzle Worcestershire all over the shrimp, about ¼ to ½ a cup. Drizzle Tabasco sauce over the top to your desired temperature. Some like it hot.
Now grab your stick of butter and cut it into pats. Place the pats of butter on top of the shrimp as evenly spaced as possible.
Place the pan of shrimp under the broiler in your oven for just about 10 minutes until the shrimp are no longer translucent. Serve with a roll of crusty French bread because you need something to absorb all of the glorious juices." tag="recipes food cooking seafood" hash="5ac2bc9e531bd20e239e082640a36c15" meta="d20b7b299dc660c8857afc31f0020f68"    />

&lt;blockquote&gt;1 tsp. kosher salt&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Heat oven to 250°. Lay bacon on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet fitted with a wire rack. Brush bacon with maple syrup; bake until the fat has rendered and the bacon is dry like jerky, 1–1½ hours. Let bacon cool and chop into ½″ pieces; set aside. Heat oven to 300°. Heat a 12″ skillet over medium; toast cashews, pecans, sesame sticks, cacao nibs, almonds, and pumpkin seeds until fragrant and beginning to color, 3–5 minutes. Add butter, sugar, salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne, cinnamon, and cumin; toss to melt butter. Remove from heat and stir in barbecue sauce; spread evenly onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake, stirring occasionally, until mixture is dry and toasted, about 25 minutes. Stir in reserved bacon, the apricots, and figs; bake 15 minutes more. Let trail mix cool completely before serving.

Aboard this vessel, Pym and a sailor named Dirk Peters continue their adventures further south. Docking on land, they encounter hostile black-skinned natives before escaping back to the ocean. The novel ends abruptly as Pym and Peters continue toward the South Pole." tag="wikipedia literature history" hash="bedbd06eca1ed66b81eaece9d5caf8ca" meta="d1c57d202ae05ec6eba2f62b691fe2c8"    />

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shopping list: Dried chiles (guajillo, ancho, or de arbol), tomatoes (canned fire-roasted if not in season; we are currently not in season), lime, garlic, cilantro&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Get out your cast iron pan and set it to medium heat. Take some chiles, break off the stems, and shake out the seeds inside. Discard stem and seeds. How many you use will depend on which variety you got as well as your taste. Ancho and guajillo are both good all-around chiles—not too spicy, a little fruity. Chiles de arbol are pretty spicy. Anyway, throw the chiles on the cast iron and watch very carefully. They’ll begin to soften and get fragrant really quickly; turn them after about a minute or two and cook for the same amount of time. Don’t let them burn; you don’t want these to be black. When pliable and smelling delicious, snag them off the pan with a pair of tongs and throw in a food processor (alternately, in a blender, or mortar and pestle, or molcajete).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Take five cloves of garlic, separated from the head but NOT peeled. Make sure the papery husk is still around each clove. Toss them into the pan and roast, turning every few minutes, until they’re all splotchy with black burn-marks. When a little soft, maybe fifteen or twenty minutes, take them out, allow to cool, then peel. Throw them in the food processor (or whatever).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If using canned tomatoes, make sure to get decent-quality fire-roasted tomatoes, because there’ll be no real way to burn the sugars in a canned tomato that’s already broken down a bit. Toss the whole can in the food processor along with a squeeze of lime and some salt and blend until smooth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If using fresh tomatoes, slice in half width-wise and place them cut side down on the cast iron pan. Do not touch them! They will sizzle and begin to burn. Wait maybe five or ten minutes until they’re soft to the touch, then scrape them up with a spatula and throw in the food processor, and complete as before. Top with chopped cilantro.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" tag="vegetables cooking recipes salsa mexico" hash="2fb6a7098040f6cdb4e2a0fc36f005cf" meta="4dbaaedc38d953f04cb27cd10de60b93"    />

The 2008 model was the first significant redesign of the KLR650 since its inception. It has a 650 cc four-stroke, DOHC, dual-counterbalanced, single-cylinder, water-cooled engine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The addition of luggage and personalized modifications (GPS, heated handgrips, larger windscreens) make it more functional on long trips.

<post href="http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words/" time="2015-03-26T17:05:11Z" description="Git in six hundred words" extended="&lt;blockquote&gt;Imagine you have a directory called alpha. It contains a file called number.txt that contains the text first.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You run git init to set up alpha as a Git repository.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You run git add number.txt to add number.txt to the index. The index is a list of all the files that Git is keeping track of. It maps filenames to the content of the files. It now has the mapping number.txt -&gt; first. Running the add command has also added a blob object containing first to the Git object database.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You run git commit -m first. This does three things. First, it creates a tree object in the objects database. This object represents the list of items in the top level of the alpha directory. This object has a pointer to the first blob object that was created when you ran git add. Second, it creates a commit object that represents the version of the repository that you have just committed. This includes a pointer to the tree object. Third, it points the master branch at the new commit object.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You run git clone . ../beta. This creates a new directory called beta. It initializes it as a Git repository. It copies the objects in the alpha objects database to the beta objects database. It points the master branch on beta at the commit object that the master branch points at on the alpha repository. It sets the index on beta to mirror the content of the first commit. It updates your files - number.txt - to mirror the index.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You move to the beta repository. You change the content of number.txt to second. You run git add number.txt and git commit -m second. The commit object that is created has a pointer to its parent, the first commit. The commit command points the master branch at the second commit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You move back to the alpha repository. You run git remote add beta ../beta. This sets the beta repository as a remote repository.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You run git pull beta master.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the covers, this runs git fetch beta master. This finds the objects for the second commit and copies them from the beta repository to the alpha repository. It points alpha’s record of beta’s master at the second commit object. It updates FETCH_HEAD to show that the master branch was fetched from the beta repository.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the covers, the pull command runs git merge FETCH_HEAD. This reads FETCH_HEAD, which shows that the master branch on the beta repository was the most recently fetched branch. It gets the commit object that alpha’s record of beta’s master is pointing at. This is the second commit. The master branch on alpha is pointing at the first commit, which is the ancestor of the second commit. This means that, to complete the merge, the merge command can just point the master branch at the second commit. The merge command updates the index to mirror the contents of the second commit. It updates the working copy to mirror the index.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You run git branch red. This creates a branch called red that points at the second commit object.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You run git checkout red. Before the checkout, HEAD pointed at the master branch. It now points at the red branch. This makes the red branch the current branch.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You set the content of number.txt to third, run git add numbers.txt and run git commit -m third.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You run git push beta red. This finds the objects for the third commit and copies them from the alpha repository to the beta repository. It points the red branch on the beta repository at the third commit object, and that’s it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These are also appropriately called “anonymous named pipes”. Process substitution is implemented in most modern shells and can be used through the syntax &lt;(command arg1 arg2). The shell runs these commands, and passes their output to a file descriptor, which on Unix systems will be something like /dev/fd/11. This file descriptor will then be substituted by your shell where the call to &lt;() was. Running a command in parenthesis in a shell invokes a seperate subprocess, so multiple uses of &lt;() are run in parallel automatically (scheduling is handled by your OS here, so you may want to use this cautiously on shared systems where more explicity setting the number of processes may be preferable). Additionally, as a subshell, each &lt;() can include its own pipes, so crazy stuff like &lt;(command arg1 | othercommand arg2) is possible, and sometimes wise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;" tag="bash linux unix shell pipes streams" hash="ace57e25a07b3e6357a61fb3abf9f288" meta="c3973e986d3db5d93ca5c1b1941e728b"    />

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;First, they are often one-liners.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Second, the important parts of the iteration – the collection, the operation and the return value – are always in the same places in every map and reduce.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Third, the code in a loop may affect variables defined before it or code that runs after it. By convention, maps and reduces are functional.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fourth, map and reduce are elemental operations. Every time a person reads a for loop, they have to work through the logic line by line. There are few structural regularities they can use to create a scaffolding on which to hang their understanding of the code. In contrast, map and reduce are at once building blocks that can be combined into complex algorithms, and elements that the code reader can instantly understand and abstract in their mind. “Ah, this code is transforming each item in this collection. It’s throwing some of the transformations away. It’s combining the remainder into a single output.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lake Vostok is located at the southern Pole of Cold, beneath Russia's Vostok Station under the surface of the central East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is at 3,488 m (11,444 ft) above mean sea level. The surface of this fresh water lake is approximately 4,000 m (13,100 ft) under the surface of the ice, which places it at approximately 500 m (1,600 ft) below sea level.

The park covers an area of 726,927 ha (7,269.27 km2; 2,806.68 sq mi), making it the second largest national park in the country. Established on 11 May 1937, it houses a representative sample of the Magellanic Subpolar Forest and western Patagonian Steppe biodiversity in good state of conservation. In 1980 it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
&gt; 
&gt; The park's name refers to the giant ice cap in the Andes range that feeds 47 large glaciers, of which 13 flow towards the Atlantic Ocean. The ice cap is the largest outside of Antarctica and Greenland. In other parts of the world, glaciers start at a height of at least 2,500 m (8,200 ft) above mean sea level, but due to the size of the ice cap, these glaciers begin at only 1,500 m (4,900 ft), sliding down to 200 m (660 ft) Los Glaciares borders Torres del Paine National Park to the south in Chilean territory." tag="wikipedia argentina southamerica nationalparks glaciers mountains oneday..." hash="3b828284c3c983ff1ac8863717c5709a" meta="d662c7ae7594b7bf4e11c90b022eadee"    />

Installed in the 1960s, the booth was eight miles (13 km) from the nearest paved road, fifteen miles (24 km) from the nearest numbered highway, and miles from any buildings. Its telephone number was originally (714) 733-9969 before the area code changed to 619 and then to 760.

<post href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telling_the_bees" time="2015-03-10T15:13:32Z" description="Telling the bees" extended="&gt; The telling of the bees is a traditional English custom, in which bees would be told of important events in their keeper's lives, such as births, marriages, or departures and returns in the household. The bees were most commonly told of deaths in their master's family. The custom was prevalent all over England, as well as in a few places in Ireland and Wales but not in Scotland. If the custom was omitted or forgotten then it was believed a penalty would be paid, that the bees might leave their hive, stop producing honey, or die. A 1950 article in the Dundee Courier Scotland, describes the practice of inviting bees to the wedding.

&gt;
&gt; - It can leave the connection open for re-use for very extended periods of time, so there's no need for that costly handshake that HTTP1 requires for every request.
&gt; - HTTP2 also uses compression, unlike HTTP1, and so the size of the request is significantly smaller - and thus faster.
&gt; - HTTP2 multiplexes; it can send and receive multiple things at the same time over one connection.
&gt; 
&gt; All that means not only are the old HTTP1 techniques not needed, they'll actually make things slower. You may be loading assets that are not required for the page being viewed (concatenation and spriting are likely to do this), and sharding invokes DNS lookups which slow things down, despite HTTP2 meaning you don't need to shard in the first place." tag="development frontend http performance" hash="6594e5d71d493e0eddb32d79d7ce13e4" meta="1bcc890b5768bd2f03c121beacf83585"    />

It is north from the American state of Montana.
&gt; 
&gt; Grasslands National Park represents the Prairie Grasslands natural region, protecting one of the nation's few remaining areas of undisturbed dry mixed-grass/shortgrass prairie grassland. The park is located in the World Wildlife Fund-defined Northern short grasslands ecoregion, which spans much of southern Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, and the northern Great Plains states in the USA. The unique landscape and harsh, semi-arid climate provide niches for several adapted plants and animals. The park and surrounding area house the country's only black-tailed prairie dog colonies. Rare and endangered fauna found in the park include the pronghorn, greater sage-grouse, burrowing owl, ferruginous hawk, prairie rattlesnake, black-footed ferret and greater short-horned lizard. Flora includes blue grama grass, needlegrass, plains cottonwood and silver sagebrush." tag="wikipedia nationalparks canada" hash="d69e5c61d44fbc9c9d98154b31ffdd1d" meta="018c86c1dd84d230c9253e491227305f"    />

Located entirely on public land, the trail links six of the National Parks on the Colorado Plateau in Southern Utah and Northern Arizona with the lesser known, but equally splendid, lands in between them. Encompassed in the route are Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon, Grand Canyon and Zion National Parks as well as Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and numerous National Forests, BLM Districts, Primitive Areas, Wilderness Areas and Wilderness Study Areas. The Hayduke Trail is not intended to be the easiest or most direct route through this incredibly varied terrain, but is rather meant to showcase the stunning Redrock Wilderness of the American Southwest. Named after George Washington Hayduke III, a fictitious character in Edward Abbey's novel The Monkey Wrench Gang, the trail seeks to pay homage to Abbey for his tireless defense of these fragile and threatened public lands and to heighten awareness and promote the conservation of the wild places that he and so many other people have come to need and love." tag="west utah hiking arizona hayduke" hash="83e6f29673e30931d4c5a866edeffd02" meta="1a6347fc1a508dd08be5dfd8e42bb8b7"    />

It is where anything can come alive and where many dreams have died. It is an impossible place.
&gt; 
&gt; The spine that runs through it connects its fabled halves, Northern and Southern, as if this divide is all there is to say about the entire state. But the spine itself belies the myth of California, the one that hovers at the very edge like an iridescent bubble and floats just out of reach every time. There is no straight shot between those storied Northern and Southern Californias. You cannot take a direct route from Los Angeles to San Francisco.

- 1 tablespoon whole cumin seeds
- 1 ½ teaspoons whole coriander seeds
- 4 pounds beef chuck roast or steak
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus extra as needed
- 1 large yellow or white onion, chopped, plus extra chopped onion for serving
- 6 large garlic cloves, minced
- 4 to 7 large fresh green jalapeños (depending on how much heat you like), stemmed, seeded and chopped
- 3 tablespoons masa harina or 1 corn tortilla, torn into pieces (optional)
- 2 tablespoons ground pure chile powder, such as pasilla, Chimayo or ancho
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 (10-ounce) bottle Negra Modelo beer
- 1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes, or 3 10-ounce cans Ro-Tel canned tomatoes with green chiles
- 1 ounce unsweetened chocolate
- 3 whole dried large red chiles, such as New Mexico or guajillo
- Chopped fresh cilantro, for serving
- Fritos or warmed flour tortillas, for serving

PREPARATION

1. In a small heavy skillet, toast cumin and coriander seeds until fragrant. In a mortar and pestle, or in a coffee grinder, grind to a powder and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, roughly cut beef into 2-inch cubes, or slice it against the grain into pieces about 1/4-inch thick by 1 1/2 inches square.
3. In a large, heavy pot over high heat, heat oil until shimmering. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, brown the meat, turning occasionally until crusty. Adjust heat to prevent scorching. As it is cooked, remove the meat to drain on paper towels. Add more oil as needed for browning, but do not clean out the pot.
4. To the empty but crusty pot, add onion, garlic, jalapeños, masa harina or tortilla (if using), chile powder, cumin-coriander powder and oregano. Cook, stirring, until onion has softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add meat, beer, tomatoes, chocolate, whole dried chiles and 1 quart water. Bring to a gentle simmer and simmer about 1 1/2 hours, or until meat is fork-tender. Remove the dried chiles.
5. Serve immediately or let cool and refrigerate. The chili tastes best one or two days after it is made.
6. Reheat over low heat if necessary and serve in bowls, sprinkled with chopped onion and cilantro. Add Fritos for crunch, or dip tortillas into the spicy gravy." tag="recipes food chili meat nytimes" hash="2169fbe7b6c8efc642bc85cb0a8b6989" meta="c62feae722d169a790f289ed9dd2e393"    />

This trend is a break from the historical pattern of diesel fuel prices usually being lower than gasoline prices except in cold winters when demand for heating oil pushed diesel fuel prices higher. The main reasons why diesel fuel prices have been higher than regular gasoline prices in recent years are:
&gt; 
&gt; Demand for diesel fuel and other distillate fuel oils have been relatively high, especially in Europe, China, India, and the United States.
&gt; The transition to less polluting, lower-sulfur diesel fuels in the United States affected diesel fuel production and distribution costs.

&gt; 
&gt; One of them takes a sip of beer and asks, “You wanna hear the funniest thing I ever heard anyone say?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Yes I do,” says the other. “That’s exactly what I want to hear.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Okay,” the man sets his bottle on the bar and begins. “This was when I was in college. Me and my friends Carter and Will and Matt went to D’angelo’s sub shop. We’d been watching football in Carter’s room and at the end of one of the games, it was getting to be dinner time, Carter said he was hungry for a sandwich. He liked the steak sandwiches at the D’angelo, so we went out to Cohen’s car, Matt’s car, and he drove us there. We were totally stoned.”
&gt; 
&gt; The bartender, a woman with red hair in a ponytail, looks up from where she’s standing at the other end of the bar, typing on her cellphone.
&gt; 
&gt; The man continued.
&gt; 
&gt; “So we get the place, and we go inside, and I’m standing there like a dipshit, staring at the menus, trying to remember how to read, when the lady walks in from the kitchen to the counter and asks us whether we were ready to order.
&gt; 
&gt; Carter says, ‘Yes, please. I’d like a number 14, grilled steak. Sans pickles, please.’
&gt; 
&gt; And the lady scrunches up her face, all quizzical-like and says, ‘Oh, I’m sorry. I don’t think we have those kind. We just have, like, normal sandwich pickles.’
&gt; 
&gt; I burst out a cough of a laugh before covering my mouth with my hands.
&gt; 
&gt; But Carter totally played it cool. Without missing a beat, he says, ‘Oh, you know what, then? I just won’t have any.’”
&gt; 
&gt; The man shakes his head, still in disbelief, and lets out a little chuckle.
&gt; 
&gt; The other man doesn’t respond at all. He takes a sip of beer and remains staring straight ahead. Then he says, “That’s not that funny.”" tag="stories lol drugs" hash="cf57e9bf4c9b34489c0edadfe8890242" meta="35238228dad269016228c335e7f48b28"    />

Until 1972, when it was replaced by Interstate Highways west of the Sacramento area, it extended (by way of Stockton, the Altamont Pass, and the Bay Bridge) to San Francisco, near the Pacific Ocean. The Interstates were constructed later and are mostly separate from this route. It generally serves a corridor south of Interstates 70 and 80 and north of Interstates 64 and 40. The route runs through mostly rural desert and mountains in the Western United States, with the section through Nevada known as &quot;The Loneliest Road in America&quot;. In the Midwest, US 50 continues through mostly rural areas of farms as well as a few large cities including Kansas City, Missouri; St. Louis, Missouri; and Cincinnati, Ohio. The route continues into the Eastern United States, where it passes through the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia before heading through Washington, D.C. From there, US 50 continues through Maryland as a high-speed road to Ocean City. Signs at each end give the length as 3,073 miles (4,946 km), but the actual distance is slightly less, due to realignments since the former figure was measured. US 50 passes through a total of 12 states (California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland) as well as the District of Columbia." tag="roads usa wikipedia highway" hash="b19670b2bc4e943418e77e28d8964068" meta="296d4e97af921cc7ec79f5de846781fa"    />

The park is roughly 17 miles (24 km) long, covering 14,350 acres (58 km2) of land along the Genesee River.
&gt; 
&gt; Within the park, there are three large waterfalls on the Genesee River and as many as fifty waterfalls found on tributaries that flow into it; the deep gorge formed by the river, with rock walls rising up to 550 feet (170 m) in places and which narrow to 400 feet (120 m) across above the middle of the three falls, prompted the area's reputation as the &quot;Grand Canyon of the East&quot;." tag="newyork stateparks rivers canyons" hash="1def404c0aec85e5374715187a4aca2c" meta="d25be3c11e380fcbccf704f95316f5d7"    />

To visualize an algorithm, we don’t merely fit data to a chart; there is no primary dataset. Instead there are logical rules that describe behavior. This may be why algorithm visualizations are so unusual, as designers experiment with novel forms to better communicate. This is reason enough to study them.
&gt; 
&gt; But algorithms are also a reminder that visualization is more than a tool for finding patterns in data.

To the north, the distinctive landscape of &quot;the Sods&quot; is characterized by stunted (“flagged”) trees, wind-carved boulders, heath barrens, grassy meadows created in the last century by logging and fires, and sphagnum bogs that are much older. To the south, a dense cove forest occupies the branched canyon excavated by the North Fork of Red Creek.

It is an intersectional extension of the idea of patriarchy[1] beyond gender.

Constructed by Mr. Sutyagin and his family over 15 years (starting in 1992), without formal plans or a building permit, the structure deteriorated while Mr. Sutyagin spent a number of years in prison for racketeering.

On December 26, 2008, the tower was pulled down, and the remainder was dismantled manually[6] over the course of the next several months.

He is a trained polyarnik, a specialist in the polar north, a meteorologist. In the past thirty years, he has lived on Russian ships and, more recently, in Khodovarikha, an Arctic outpost, where he was sent by the state to measure the temperatures, the snowfall, the winds. The outpost lies on a fingernail of a peninsula that juts into the Barents Sea. The closest town, by any definition, is an hour away by helicopter. He has a wife, but she lives far away, in Arkhangelsk. They have no children. On his rare visits to Arkhangelsk, he has trouble negotiating the traffic and the noise. Arkhangelsk is not Hong Kong. Korotki is sixty-three, and when he began his career he was an enthusiast, a romantic about the open spaces and the conditions of the Arctic. He watches the news on TV but doesn’t fully believe it. Polyarniki were like cosmonauts, explorers for the Soviet state. There are fewer now. Who wants to live like this anymore? Evgenia Arbugaeva, a photographer who grew up in the Arctic town of Tiksi, spent two extended stays with Korotki. “The world of cities is foreign to him—he doesn’t accept it,” she says. “I came with the idea of a lonely hermit who ran away from the world because of some heavy drama, but it wasn’t true. He doesn’t get lonely at all. He kind of disappears into tundra, into the snowstorms. He doesn’t have a sense of self the way most people do. It’s as if he were the wind, or the weather itself.”" tag="russia arctic weather exploration photography people" hash="096aca69105789f4d404d5bacfff97f0" meta="d514f7600e4280060f733772b433e9d3"    />

Unix beat out the LISP machines. If you consider mobile handsets, many of which run descendants of Unix (iOS and Android), Unix beat out Windows as well. And HTML5 beat out all of the various initiatives to create a single unified web. It nods to accessibility; it doesn’t get in the way of those who want to make something huge and interconnected. But it doesn’t enforce; it doesn’t seek to change the behavior of page creators in the same way that such lost standards as XHTML 2.0 (which emerged from the offices of the World Wide Web Consortium, and then disappeared under the weight of its own intentions) once did.
&gt; It’s not a bad place to end up. It means that there is no single framework, no set of easy rules to learn, no overarching principles that, once learned, can make the web appear like a golden statue atop a mountain. There are just components: HTML to get the words on the page, forms to get people to write in, videos and images to put up pictures, moving or otherwise, and JavaScript to make everything dance." tag="history computers technology internet fileformats html" hash="f113c630bbbcfb392831a5957ec66cec" meta="d71222594533669643d57eb5d2941474"    />

<post href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/group-rules-web" time="2014-11-22T04:01:01Z" description="The Group That Rules the Web" extended="&gt; how does the W3C’s HTML5 standard look in its totality? It’s long. Looooong. Looooooooong. The section on images is fourteen thousand words, and it is just one tiny section in a figure-laden work running almost five hundred and thirty thousand words long—over five times as long as the HTML4 specification it recommended, in 1997, though still a little shorter than “Infinite Jest.”
&gt; 
&gt; And yet, this massive, exhaustive spec describes barely a fraction of what truly defines the Web. For example, it doesn’t say how one might go about making a JPG or a GIF, or how those files are arranged in binary streams of data. It simply tells you how to point to the images in a Web page. For all the other stuff, there are other standards, written in other rooms, by other people. And those standards are based on even more standards, all the way down, going back decades.

...

&gt;A standard is a skewed mirror of culture, and HTML5 is no different. Here is what it tells us we care about: words, headlines, video, and audio. We like to organize things into lists, and we like to look at pictures. And we want everything to be capable of animation and interaction—every letter, every tag, every structural element. Every bit of HTML5 is open to interpretation by code, available to be twisted, rotated, and manipulated by its users.
&gt;
&gt;The Web, which used to be a place you went to get things, is now also a place to do things. That took a decade. It is 2014, and we have HTML5—the markup we deserve, and here to stay. Just like with the Buffalo Conference, of 1908, you will be able to hear the music a hundred years from now, as long as you have the right kind of player piano." tag="web html5 standards w3c internet history" hash="efb5d2d508ac8d00ad7e2b857b8f36fa" meta="eaf8b72e74a12f49dd527962c7af7367"    />

Indifference to what words actually say; willingness to accept a vapid truism as a useful, even revelatory concept; carelessness about where a supposed quotation comes from — that’s all part of what I like least about the Internet.

...

&gt; A very wonderful statement of the necessity, and the difficulty, of maintaining a connection to one’s own child-self is Wordsworth’s Ode on Intimations of Immortality. The poem offers a profoundly felt, profoundly thoughtful, radical argument:

     Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting.

Instead of seeing birth as an awakening from blank nonbeing into the child’s fullness of being, and maturity as a narrowing, impoverishing journey towards blank death, the Ode proposes that a soul enters life forgetting its eternal being, can remember it throughout life only in intimations and moments of revelation, and will recall and rejoin it fully only in death." tag="language literature internet quotes fuck damnation death birth life" hash="18f59bdf8a7053e16c5e13d46767c1d8" meta="d0cccacfcba2e0e7baf6a824e335ec79"    />

&gt; 
&gt; Maybe that’s not a clear question. Okay.
&gt; 
&gt; When you think about or use the internet, what do you see?
&gt; 
&gt; For a lot of people, the answer is that they see screens–browsers, software, laptops, phones. Maybe they see some hardware in the form of a wifi router. The internet is a network, but individual users mostly just get a glimpse of it, usually by peering into black mirrors. The most popular stock photography of internet infrastructure–data centers full of servers and cables–tends to make the physical internet feel clinical, distant, opaque.
&gt; 
&gt; When I think about the internet, I think about scale. Computers used to be the size of entire rooms. While the hardware has gotten a lot smaller, the room has actually gotten bigger–we’re surrounded by sensors, cables, cameras, all the stuff of networks, and the number of networked objects around us is only going to increase. These pieces of the network are at times hard, but not impossible, to see–if you know what you’re looking for and how to look. And once you start looking, it’s hard to stop noticing all the pieces of networks that are around us all the time." tag="networks internet cities nyc urbanism surveillance technology" hash="d84201ca1f281113a9d156a3626c35e3" meta="fdd6d0a14641c3b585001059744476ca"    />

The project embodies the tensions between consumers and producers, art and commerce, popular culture and its critical commentator, which obviously have gained the trio extraordinary popularity in both fashion and art circles, perceived as self-reflective meta-narrative. “Between art and fashion we’re kind of taking advantage of what each one of them doesn’t know about the other one, and then what both of them don’t know about China,” says Radboy, while emphasizing that although SB problematizes institutional critique in its performative gestures, they are in no way critically-distanced cultural commentators, elevated from the criticized phenomenon: “It’s important to communicate that we’re not a brand about Shanzhai – we are actual shanzhai; we’re not commenting on something, we belong to the phenomenon.” He continues: “The project is authentically commercial. We totally implicate ourselves in the real economies we work in. If there is a critique produced it is physically embedded in our products — the same way it is in shanzhai products; the objects contain a critique, but the producers are only interested in profit.” Exploring the dynamics of marketing, SB challenges not only mainstream consumer culture, but the art market and its performed heroism as a cultural sector.

It replaced both the legendary 300 SL (W 198) and the 190 SL (W 121 BII). Of the 48,912 W 113 SLs produced, 19,440 were sold in the US.
&gt; 
&gt; The W 113 SL was developed under the auspices of Mercedes-Benz Technical Director Fritz Nallinger, Chief Engineer Rudolf Uhlenhaut and Head of Styling Friedrich Geiger. The lead designers were Paul Bracq and Béla Barényi, who created its distinctive, patented, slightly concave hardtop, which inspired the &quot;Pagoda&quot; nickname.
&gt; 
&gt; All models were equipped with an inline-six cylinder engine with multi-port fuel injection. The bonnet, trunk lid, door skins and tonneau cover were made of aluminum to reduce weight. The comparatively short and wide chassis, combined with an excellent suspension, powerful brakes and radial tires gave the W 113 superb handling for its time. The styling of the front, with its characteristic upright Bosch &quot;fishbowl&quot; headlights and simple chrome grille, dominated by the large three-pointed star in the nose panel, paid homage to the then already legendary 300 SL roadster.
&gt; 
&gt; W 113 SLs were typically configured as a &quot;Coupe/Roadster&quot; with a soft-top and an optional removable hardtop. A 2+2 was introduced with the 250 SL &quot;California Coupe,&quot; which had a fold-down rear bench seat instead of the soft-top." tag="mercedes cars wikipedia" hash="f7f5e4b5eac11cd4ec405dd8f7821b71" meta="b3aa773f31559236a08d12277a5f9767"    />

<post href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-stroke_engine" time="2014-11-03T21:26:09Z" description="Four-stroke engine" extended="&gt; A four-stroke engine (also known as four-cycle) is an internal combustion engine in which the piston completes four separate strokes which constitute a single thermodynamic cycle. A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder, in either direction. The four separate strokes are termed:
&gt; 
&gt; Intake: this stroke of the piston begins at top dead center. The piston descends from the top of the cylinder to the bottom of the cylinder, increasing the volume of the cylinder. A mixture of fuel and air is forced by atmospheric (or greater by some form of air pump) pressure into the cylinder through the intake port.
&gt; Compression: with both intake and exhaust valves closed, the piston returns to the top of the cylinder compressing the air or fuel-air mixture into the cylinder head.
&gt; Power: this is the start of the second revolution of the cycle. While the piston is close to Top Dead Centre, the compressed air–fuel mixture in a gasoline engine is ignited, by a spark plug in gasoline engines, or which ignites due to the heat generated by compression in a diesel engine. The resulting pressure from the combustion of the compressed fuel-air mixture forces the piston back down toward bottom dead centre.
&gt; Exhaust: during the exhaust stroke, the piston once again returns to top dead centre while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent fuel-air mixture through the exhaust valve(s)." tag="engineering engines wikipedia" hash="71281c938d96e7b24a56309493958b3a" meta="1baa202662caf40ed3ecbb68bd97d459"    />

To live outside of the city is to leave that grid to settle for an older, lesser grid, in which cheaper products don't come to you but the other way around. You can still get more expensive things delivered, or cheaper things delivered for a fee, or just Amazon things, but probably not coffee or one bowl of soup or laundry. Stopping by the coffee shop, in this future optimum urban utopia, is either an economic necessity or an affectation, either downscale or premium, like thrift shopping vs. vintage shopping.

&gt;     The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

&gt;     The best lack all conviction, while the worst

&gt; 
&gt;     Surely some revelation is at hand;
&gt;     Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
&gt;     The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out
&gt;     When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
&gt;     Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;
&gt;     A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
&gt;     A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
&gt;     Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
&gt;     Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.
&gt; 
&gt;     The darkness drops again but now I know

Each is barely larger than four sheets of plywood. They are made from wood, are off-grid and autonomous, their outsides burnt black. This project is part polemic, part escape. Holiday homes have become this country’s decadence. Our sub-prime estuarine site permitted a 1500m² palace. It forbade two 29m² cabins. At night we talked excitedly about Malevich’s Suprematism; in the morning we got up and wrote legal submissions on visual density and the attrition of driveways. We wanted a different vision for New Zealand’s coastal future. In these houses a history of prismatic abstraction is conflated with a poetic of small boats bobbing in a sea of grass. There are no doors. One climbs up boulders and in through a window instead. We hoped that in subverting the shorthand language of building these little constructions might feel like something other than – and more than – houses." tag="architecture home newzealand cabins" hash="4246704e1e0fc6cd890a913d62676299" meta="dc66b1ba1829e7f30a5fbc60873f341f"    />

<post href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachamama" time="2014-10-27T18:01:09Z" description="Pachamama" extended="&gt; Pachamama is a goddess revered by the indigenous people of the Andes. She is also known as the earth/time mother. In Inca mythology, Pachamama is a fertility goddess who presides over planting and harvesting. She causes earthquakes and is typically in the form of a dragon. She is also an ever present and independent deity who has her own self-sufficient and creative power to sustain life on this earth. Pachamama is the wife of Pacha Kamaq and her children are Inti, the sun god, and Killa, the moon goddess. In Quechua cosmology, these are the four organizing principles of nature based on water, earth, sun, and moon. Llamas as well as burned, elaborate miniature garments are sacrificed to her. After the conquest by Spain, which forced conversion to Roman Catholicism, the figure of the Virgin Mary became united with that of the Pachamama for many of the indigenous people. In pre-Hispanic literature, Pachamama is seen as a cruel goddess eager to collect her sacrifices. As Peru began to form into a nation, however, Pachamama began to be–and to this day is–perceived as being benevolent and giving. She is also seen as nature itself. Thus, problems arise when people take too much from nature because they are taking too much from Pachamama." tag="wikipedia religion america" hash="f162b719acca320c5124e86d7a2c957e" meta="8a550dbd4363ca09d5fa618477120977"    />

While good tools integrate seamlessly with your own environment, bad ones will constantly frustrate your efforts. Good tools have a seemingly limitless application, constrained only by your own imagination. Bad tools, on the other hand, will often require that you deploy a salvo of brittle hacks to keep them barely working in your own environment.
&gt; 
&gt; I don’t want to attempt to explain what makes for good design; this has been discussed elsewhere. Instead, I want to outline a few established customs that you should take care to follow when writing new tools. While making a truly good tool can be an elusive goal, it isn’t difficult to avoid making a truly bad one. Unix demands good citizenry from its tools: it relies on a set of conventions to make things work, and importantly, to compose, well. Here follows a few key customs, often violated.

It’s the stillness of the observer, not the dioramas, that feels important. The stillness, the darkness—they are the very opposite of exposure, they provide a kind of protection from the drama of the hungry mammals, from the violence of the scenes; and from the violence, too, of the human natural history giants who lived, and collected, before the dawn of environmentalism. These animals were hunted and shot and collected and stuffed and placed in their cases as confident trophies of the great diversity of the natural world. They are meant to be marveled at, that’s why they’re there. The conservationism of the generation that created the museum, men like John Muir and John Burroughs and Teddy Roosevelt, grew out of awe more than fear. Nature was not yet itself an endangered species, it was instead a glorious spectacle. That’s an illusion, no less than Sugimoto’s photographic illusions, but that’s what the museum’s darkness allows us to experience—that uncomplicated wonder, that innocence." tag="museums environmentalism photography history books" hash="aa4e2ed192c40e73010b34e48f4d66db" meta="03a53f23b9b299f6ec22f2b0709c7ac7"    />

&gt; 
&gt; The True American Diner is a casual sit-down restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner—all three meals—all day, often for all twenty-four hours of it. Time has no meaning in the presence of eggs, steak and hash browns. Portions are large but not obscene; sides are available with nearly everything. The food is sturdy and simple, a few strong flavors and techniques.

Because of the bug, the processor can return incorrect decimal results, an issue troublesome for the precise calculations needed in fields like math and science. Discovered by Professor Thomas R. Nicely at Lynchburg College, Intel blamed the error on missing entries in the lookup table used by the floating-point division circuitry.
&gt; 
&gt; Though rarely encountered by average users (Byte magazine estimated that 1 in 9 billion floating point divides with random parameters would produce inaccurate results),[3] both the flaw and Intel's initial handling of the matter were heavily criticized. Intel ultimately recalled the defective processors." tag="wikipedia computers hardware bugs history" hash="5293f09f7785b436914a088cfe494016" meta="cfc12f46a56fb53f2db68a7165d9ac32"    />

The park and preserve covers 4,093,077 acres (6,395.43 sq mi; 16,564.09 km2), being roughly the size of Wales. Most of this is a designated wilderness area in the national park where all hunting is banned, including over 3,922,000 acres (1,587,000 ha) of land. The park is named after Mount Katmai, its centerpiece stratovolcano. The park is located on the Alaska Peninsula, across from Kodiak Island, with headquarters in nearby King Salmon, about 290 miles (470 km) southwest of Anchorage. The area was first designated a national monument in 1918 to protect the area around the major 1912 volcanic eruption of Novarupta, which formed the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, a 40-square-mile (100 km2), 100-to-700-foot-deep (30 to 213 m) pyroclastic flow.

It's a complete realization of several artistic aims, and of all his albums it remains the most distinctive-- there are hardly any successful imitators of its unique universe. As Discreet Music foretold the manner by which Eno would realize self-contained musical environments, On Land presages the sound of several musical elements acting independently, coinciding only by chance yet remaining cohesive. The tracks of On Land, all fairly unchanging environments in this way, seem to similarly extend infinitely past the boundaries of their beginnings and ends.
&gt; Eno has talked of finding his inspiration for On Land in Ghana, when he used a microphone and headphones to hear the conflated sounds of his surrounding radius. &quot;The effect of this simple technological system was to cluster all the disparate sounds into one aural frame; they became music.&quot; (For a demonstration of this effect, just walk around outside with a microphone amplified into a pair of headphones: It really is striking to hear the world flattened into two dimensions upon one's ears.) The result was an attempt to make dense &quot;worlds&quot; of sound using the same sense of disparate yet spatially connected elements. The album is both more varied than his other ambient works and more foreboding. The atmospheres in many of On Land's pieces are so dense as to leave one staring down a chasm of sound, with no visible bottom apparent. Eno used several nonmusical objects and field recordings to contribute to On Land's thick aural web, the album being a testament to Eno's use of the studio as an instrument. On Land intensifies the most subtle and indescribable of emotions, and it stands at the forefront of the transformative possibilities inherent in non-rhythmic, non-melodic music." tag="music ambient eno" hash="40fb50889aaeb0885c2c0342695d0490" meta="6e42150df573e075ac5cb795986b1e1e"    />

It won't compile, the web server throws an error, or gives the wrong output. Writing and design almost always sorta work...even a first draft or an initial design communicates something to the reader/viewer. When the code works within the specifications, it's done. The writing or design process is never done; even a great piece of writing or the best design can be improved incrementally or even scrapped altogether to go in a different and potentially more fruitful direction. Maybe, for me, programming's definite ending is what makes it so enjoyable. The flow state comes from knowing that, while the journey is difficult and maddening and messily creative (just as with writing or design), there's a definite point at which it's done and you can move on to the next challenge." tag="programming work" hash="29eddedbfee711b4de8030453af57505" meta="8342e6b45d8db58161827030281251d9"    />

<post href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)" time="2014-06-18T03:14:49Z" description="Monad (functional programming)" extended="&gt; In functional programming, a monad is a structure that represents computations defined as sequences of steps. A type with a monad structure defines what it means to chain operations, or nest functions of that type together. This allows the programmer to build pipelines that process data in steps, in which each action is decorated with additional processing rules provided by the monad. As such, monads have been described as &quot;programmable semicolons&quot;; a semicolon is the operator used to chain together individual statements in many imperative programming languages, thus the expression implies that extra code will be executed between the statements in the pipeline. Monads have also been explained with a physical metaphor as assembly lines, where a conveyor belt transports data between functional units that transform it one step at a time. They can also be seen as a functional design pattern to build generic types." tag="programming wikipedia functions" hash="be54b26dce958a62ce3c07eaf8f4af11" meta="64cc2ddca3dc88dd7705a1e88cc7e17d"    />

<post href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix" time="2014-06-02T20:45:40Z" description="History of Unix" extended="&gt; The history of Unix dates back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&amp;T Bell Labs, and General Electric were developing an experimental time sharing operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe. Multics introduced many innovations, but had many problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Bell Labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims, slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, M. D. McIlroy, and J. F. Ossanna, decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. In 1979, Dennis Ritchie described their vision for Unix:
&gt; 
&gt; What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.
&gt; 
&gt; While Ken Thompson still had access to the Multics environment, he wrote simulations for the new file and paging system on it. He also programmed a game called Space Travel, but the game needed a more efficient and less expensive machine to run on, and eventually he found a little-used PDP-7 at Bell Labs. On this PDP-7, in 1969, a team of Bell Labs researchers led by Thompson and Ritchie, including Rudd Canaday, developed a hierarchical file system, the concepts of computer processes and device files, a command-line interpreter, and some small utility programs." tag="history computers unix os wikipedia cli" hash="f833477d0e297bdd5f41fa682584125e" meta="c675441b343e0500b247ad50f5371065"    />

<post href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm" time="2014-06-02T02:54:19Z" description="Dijkstra's algorithm" extended="&gt; Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956 and published in 1959, is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree. This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.
&gt; 
&gt; For a given source vertex (node) in the graph, the algorithm finds the path with lowest cost (i.e. the shortest path) between that vertex and every other vertex. It can also be used for finding costs of shortest paths from a single vertex to a single destination vertex by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination vertex has been determined. For example, if the vertices of the graph represent cities and edge path costs represent driving distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities. As a result, the shortest path algorithm is widely used in network routing protocols, most notably IS-IS and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).
&gt;
&gt; Dijkstra's original algorithm does not use a min-priority queue and runs in time O(|V|^2) (where |V| is the number of vertices). The idea of this algorithm is also given in (Leyzorek et al. 1957). The implementation based on a min-priority queue implemented by a Fibonacci heap and running in O(|E|+|V|\log|V|) (where |E| is the number of edges) is due to (Fredman &amp; Tarjan 1984). This is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm for arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights." tag="algorithm computers programming" hash="39f3b9bb84a491f6ec044a8640febbaa" meta="f1e2826177b1bc8d6c2413e171dbb3a7"    />

&gt; Flashback to 1983
&gt; 'Chronic Town' was their first EP

&gt; 'Finster's Art', and titles to match

&gt; 'South Central Rain', 'Don't Go Back To Rockville'

&gt; And the drummer, he knew restraint
&gt; And the bass man, he had all the right moves

<post href="http://benfry.com/traces/" time="2014-05-22T16:26:22Z" description="On the Origin of Species: The Preservation of Favoured Traces | Ben Fry" extended="&gt; We often think of scientific ideas, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, as fixed notions that are accepted as finished. In fact, Darwin's On the Origin of Species evolved over the course of several editions he wrote, edited, and updated during his lifetime. The first English edition was approximately 150,000 words and the sixth is a much larger 190,000 words. In the changes are refinements and shifts in ideas — whether increasing the weight of a statement, adding details, or even a change in the idea itself.
&gt; The second edition, for instance, adds a notable “by the Creator” to the closing paragraph, giving greater attribution to a higher power. In another example, the phrase “survival of the fittest” — usually considered central to the theory and often attributed to Darwin — instead came from British philosopher Herbert Spencer, and didn't appear until the fifth edition of the text. Using the six editions as a guide, we can see the unfolding and clarification of Darwin's ideas as he sought to further develop his theory during his lifetime." tag="history evolution science visualization text literature" hash="c214319fd9d372bfae5d6096c4a0de22" meta="e68029cbfc45e06188324145e1298150"    />

Most have detailed liner notes on their back covers, analyzing the compositions and providing a biography of the composer, in a format typical of classical music albums, and much of the material can be regarded as 20th century classical music. The label provided a venue for experimental music, and its association with Eno gave increased public exposure to its composers and musicians.

Yes, the grocery. A little ammonia is not going to kill you, you pussy. You want to be all fancy and grass-fed and environmentally conscious, go ahead, I don't give a shit, just get a fucking steak. Ribeye is good. And, yes, bone-in. Schmuck. Take the steak home. Get a bigass frying pan and put the shit on the stove, cranking the heat up as far as that fucker will go. Take a shitload of salt—rocksalt, you dumb motherfucker, none of that fine-grained crap here—and toss it around the bottom of the pan. When the pan is hot as all fuck—it should scorch the shit out of your finger if you're stupid enough to touch it—put the fucking steak on there. You can crack some pepper on the top of the steak as the bottom is searing, but don't even talk to me about garlic or onion powder or COMPOUND FUCKING BUTTER, asshole. This is steak, all you fucking need is salt and pepper. After a bit (3 minutes for pink, 5 for cooked good), flip that shit over and do the same fucking thing you just did with the other side, i.e. sit on your ass and wait for your motherfucking steak to be ready, you useless assbag. When you're done, sling that shit on a plate. Beringer's 1996 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley Private Reserve makes an absolutely delightful accompaniment, particularly if you've taken care to let it breathe a bit before quaffing. Also, make some fucking potatoes, because that's what you eat with a fucking steak.

<post href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise" time="2014-05-09T18:38:54Z" description="Colors of noise" extended="&gt; In audio engineering, electronics, physics, and many other fields, the color of a noise signal (a signal produced by a stochastic process) is generally understood to be some broad characteristic of its power spectrum.
&gt; 
&gt; Different &quot;colors&quot; of noise have significantly different properties: for example, as audio signals they will sound differently to human ears, and as images they will have a visibly different texture. Therefore, each application typically requires noise of a specific &quot;color&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; This sense of &quot;color&quot; for noise signals is similar to the concept of timbre in music (which is also called &quot;tone color&quot;); however the latter is almost always used for sound, and may consider very detailed features of the spectrum.
&gt; 
&gt; The practice of naming kinds of noise after colors started with &quot;white noise&quot;, a signal whose spectrum has equal power within any equal interval of frequencies. That name was given by analogy with &quot;white light&quot;, which was (incorrectly) assumed to have such a &quot;flat&quot; power spectrum over the visible range. Other color names, like &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, and &quot;blue&quot; were then given to noise with other spectral profiles; often (but not always) in reference to the color of light with similar spectra. Some of those names have standard definitions in certain disciplines, while others are very informal and poorly defined." tag="wikipedia noise sound" hash="dc4c854525d560746e1cecda180e4268" meta="70a211ce371f7a3c0ccdd66fa7d44afb"    />

In 2010, it was designed and made into a scale model by Julijonas Urbonas, a PhD candidate at the Royal College of Art in London. Urbonas, who has worked at an amusement park, stated that the goal of his concept roller coaster is to take lives &quot;with elegance and euphoria&quot;. As for practical applications of his design, Urbonas mentioned &quot;euthanasia&quot; or &quot;execution&quot;. John Allen, who served as president of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, inspired Urbonas with his description of the &quot;ultimate&quot; roller coaster as one that &quot;sends out 24 people and they all come back dead&quot;. As it would euthanise its passengers, it was criticised by the anti-euthanasia association Care Not Killing." tag="death physics wikipedia wtf" hash="c24a9486bccfd2310d772d917e08ae4b" meta="8bb66e52306ad7474a59e2bc1edb2368"    />

Cryptography is often used to replace or in combination with steganography. In the past, cryptography helped ensure secrecy in important communications, such as those of spies, military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field of cryptography has expanded its remit in two ways. Firstly, it provides mechanisms for more than just keeping secrets: schemes like digital signatures and digital cash, for example. Secondly, cryptography has come to be in widespread use by many civilians who do not have extraordinary needs for secrecy, although typically it is transparently built into the infrastructure for computing and telecommunications, and users are not aware of it.

This region on the Pacific Coast is the most famous of several that have sought to adopt the name of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States. Thomas Jefferson sent the Lewis and Clark expedition into the Pacific Northwest in 1803, and envisioned the establishment of an independent nation in the western portion of North America which he dubbed the &quot;Republic of the Pacific&quot;, hence the association of his name with regional autonomy. The independence movement (rather than statehood) is instead known as Cascadia.

The name &quot;Jefferson&quot; has also been used for other proposed states: the name was proposed in the 19th century for Jefferson Territory (roughly modern Colorado), as well as in 1915 in a bill in the Texas legislature for a proposed state that would be created from the Texas Panhandle region." tag="california oregon usa america wikipedia west" hash="5066afb152818c713778f0cb2fde08ce" meta="8ceaaa7391ace7531f489e8aa54d0ad7"    />

===

On a VPS to increase speed (I used a Digital Ocean VPS):

wget http://imaputils.googlecode.com/svn-history/r5/trunk/imapcopy.pl

Create a text file called map with the following contents:

[Gmail]/Sent Mail:Sent Items
[Gmail]/All Mail:Archive

Using screen, open up some stunnels. In two separate windows (so both continue to run):

stunnel -c -f -d 1143 -r imap.gmail.com:993 -P ''
stunnel -c -f -d 1144 -r fastmail.fm:993 -P ''

Note that you may need to replace fastmail.fm with mail.messagingengine.com.

In yet another screen window run the following, replacing the user-specific stuff as necessary (including an app-specific password if you're using 2-factor authentication for Google):

perl imapcopy.pl \
  -S localhost:1143/your.google.name@gmail.com/google.password \
  -D localhost:1144/your@new.account/new.password \
  -M map -m &quot;[Gmail]/All Mail,[Gmail]/Sent Mail&quot;

<post href="http://longform.org/stories/stickeen-john-muir" time="2014-03-31T15:10:01Z" description="Longform Reprints: Stickeen: The Story of a Dog by John Muir" extended="&gt; He knew very well what I meant, and at last, with the courage of despair, hushed and breathless, he crouched down on the brink in the hollow I had made for my knees, pressed his body against the ice as if trying to get the advantage of the friction of every hair, gazed into the first step, put his little feet together and slid them slowly, slowly over the edge and down into it, bunching all four in it and almost standing on his head. Then, without lifting his feet, as well as I could see through the snow, he slowly worked them over the edge of the step and down into the next and the next in succession in the same way, and gained the end of the bridge. Then, lifting his feet with the regularity and slowness of the vibrations of a seconds pendulum, as if counting and measuring one-two-three , holding himself steady against the gusty wind, and giving separate attention to each little step, he gained the foot of the cliff, while I was on my knees leaning over to give him a lift should he succeed in getting within reach of my arm. Here he halted in dead silence, and it was here I feared he might fail, for dogs are poor climbers. I had no cord. If I had had one, I would have dropped a noose over his head and hauled him up. But while I was thinking whether an available cord might be made out of clothing, he was looking keenly into the series of notched steps and finger-holds I had made, as if counting them, and fixing the position of each one of them in his mind. Then suddenly up he came in a springy rush, hooking his paws into the steps and notches so quickly that I could not see how it was done, and whizzed past my head, safe at last!
&gt;
&gt; And now came a scene! &quot;Well done, well done, little boy! Brave boy!&quot; I cried, trying to catch and caress him; but he would not be caught. Never before or since have I seen anything like so passionate a revulsion from the depths of despair to exultant, triumphant, uncontrollable joy. He flashed and darted hither and thither as if fairly demented, screaming and shouting, swirling round and round in giddy loops and circles like a leaf in a whirlwind, lying down, and rolling over and over, sidewise and heels over head, and pouring forth a tumultuous flood of hysterical cries and sobs and gasping mutterings. When I ran up to him to shake him, fearing he might die of joy, he flashed off two or three hundred yards, his feet in a mist of motion; then, turning suddenly, came back in a wild rush and launched himself at my face, almost knocking me down. all the while screeching and screaming and shouting as if saying, &quot;Saved! saved! saved!&quot; Then away again, dropping suddenly at times with his feet in the air, trembling and fairly sobbing. Such passionate emotion was enough to kill him. Moses' stately song of triumph after escaping the Egyptians and the Red Sea was nothing to it. Who could have guessed the capacity of the dull, enduring little fellow for all that most stirs this mortal frame? Nobody could have helped crying with him!
&gt;
&gt; But there is nothing like work for toning down excessive fear or joy. So I ran ahead, calling him in as gruff a voice as I could command to come on and stop his nonsense, for we had far to go and it would soon he dark. Neither of us feared another trial like this. Heaven would surely count one enough for a lifetime. The ice ahead was gashed by thousands of crevasses, but they were common ones. The joy of deliverance burned in us like fire, and we ran without fatigue, every muscle with immense rebound glorying in its strength. Stickeen flew across everything in his way, and not till dark did he settle into his normal fox-like trot. At last the cloudy mountains came in sight, and we soon felt the solid rock beneath our feet, and were safe. Then came weakness. Danger had vanished, and so had our strength. We tottered down the lateral moraine in the dark, over boulders and tree trunks, through the bushes and devil-club thickets of the grove where we had sheltered ourselves in the morning, and across the level mudslope of the terminal moraine. We reached camp about ten o'clock, and found a big fire and a big supper. A party of Hoona Indians had visited Mr. Young, bringing a gift of porpoise meat and wild strawberries, and Hunter Joe had brought in a wild goat. But we lay down, too tired to eat much, and soon fell into a troubled sleep. The man who said, &quot;The harder the toil, the sweeter the rest,&quot; never was profoundly tired. Stickeen kept springing up and muttering in his sleep, no doubt dreaming that he was still on the brink of the crevasse; and so did I, that night and many others long afterward, when I was over-tired.
&gt;
&gt; Thereafter Stickeen was a changed dog. During the rest of the trip, instead of holding aloof, he always lay by my side, tried to keep me constantly in sight, and would hardly accept a morsel of food, however tempting, from any hand but mine. At night, when all was quiet about the camp-fire, he would come to me and rest his head on my knee with a look of devotion as if I were his god. And often as he caught my eye he seemed to be trying to say, &quot;Wasn't that an awful time we had together on the glacier?&quot;" tag="nature dogs mountains adventure alaska" hash="086846f0b781a34a8121c9e86870cfc2" meta="46f4faf46f3b562adb5a0755fafa0067"    />

A major improvement over GeoJSON is that TopoJSON files collects lines as arcs made of sequences of points, and then defines both complex polylines and polygons as sequences of previously defined arcs. Shapes are sequences of arcs, arcs are sequences of points. Each arc is defined once and only once, but could be called several times, thus reducing redundancy, decreasing the file size, easing edits of neighbor shapes in an unified edit on the common arc(s) thus avoiding artifacts apparitions. The client side JavaScript library converts TopoJSON files into GeoJSON which allows other systems such D3.js to use this GIS data and generate SVG graphisms. The console script allows the conversion of GIS files (shapefiles, GeoJSON, etc.) into lighter TopoJSON files, as well as various basic processing such simplification, merge, conserve selected properties, append external data, etc." tag="javascript json maps data" hash="970269fbf9e0ddf88de586833c828981" meta="7be5fe165c02164793fff997b5ab7802"    />

<post href="http://blog.sourcing.io/mvc-style-guide" time="2014-03-22T00:50:22Z" description="JavaScript MVC Style Guide" extended="Controllers

Controllers are the glue between views and models. Most of their logic concerns event management. Keep controllers skinny.
Any communication between children and parent controllers should use events (do not pass an instance of the parent around).
Should only know about sub controllers.
Should be scoped to a single element, and not access or alter other parts of the DOM.
Should have a unique class name, and all CSS relevant to this controller should be namespaced by this class name.
Should work even if their element is not appended to the DOM tree. This is useful for testing and demonstrating the controller is properly scoped.
Should be testable by firing events programatically on their sub elements.
Should be able to be re-rendered at any time without adverse effects.
Should not use the DOM to store state — keep any view specific state stored as instance properties in the controller.

Views

Should be logic less except for flow control and helper functions.
Should be passed all the data they need to render directly. It should all be available in the current scope.

Models

Should purely be concerned with data, manipulating data and decorating data.
Should never access controllers or views.
Should never access or return DOM nodes.
Should only access or require other models at runtime.
Should abstract away XHR connections from the rest of the application.
Should contain all data validations.

Routers

Should be as logic-less as possible.
Should not know about or access the DOM.
Global state

Should be kept to a minimum as it arguably violates MVC. You can't get around it for some things though, like the current user, current view, CSRF token etc.
Should never be stored in global variables.
Should all be stored in one place (such as a singleton instance of a model).

Modules

You should always use a module system, whether it's CommonJS, AMD, ES6 modules, or something equivalent.
Never set or access global variables." tag="javascript mvc styleguide programming" hash="a22238915e96c3eb196622a417be0243" meta="429398cac546ae56e0870998ef0814bd"    />

&gt; Time 40 minutes
&gt; 
&gt; Cassoulet is one of the best of the myriad of traditional European
&gt; dishes that combine beans and meat to produce wonderful rich,
&gt; robust stews. This recipe maintains that spirit, but is much faster,
&gt; easier, less expensive, and more contemporary, emphasizing the
&gt; beans and vegetables over meat. (That probably makes it more,
&gt; not less, traditional, since meat was always hard to come by before
&gt; the mid-20th century.)

&gt; Ingredients

&gt; 2 tablespoons olive oil
&gt; 1 pound Italian sausages, bone-in pork chops, confit duck legs, or duck breasts, or a combination
&gt; 1 tablespoon chopped garlic
&gt; 2 leeks or onions, trimmed, washed, and sliced
&gt; 2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch lengths
&gt; 3 celery stalks, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
&gt; 2 medium zucchinis or 1 small head green cabbage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
&gt; Salt and freshly ground black pepper
&gt; 4 cups chopped tomatoes, with their juice (canned are fine)
&gt; 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley leaves
&gt; 1 tablespoon fresh chopped thyme leaves
&gt; 2 bay leaves
&gt; 4 cups cooked white beans (canned are OK), drained and liquid reserved in any case
&gt; 2 cups stock, dry red wine, bean cooking liquid, or water, plus more as needed
&gt; 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste

&gt; Method

&gt; 1. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, add the meat, and cook, turning as needed, until the meat is deeply browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and drain off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat.
&gt; 2. Turn the heat to medium and add the garlic, leeks or onions, carrots, celery, and zucchini or cabbage; and sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, their liquid, the reserved meat, and the herbs and bring to a boil. Add the beans; bring to a boil again, stirring occasionally, then reduce the heat so the mixture bubbles gently but continuously. Cook for about 20 minutes, adding the liquid when the mixture gets thick and the vegetables are melting away.
&gt; 3. Fish out the meat and remove the bones and skin as needed. Chop into chunks and return to the pot along with the cayenne. Cook another minute or two to warm through, then taste and adjust seasoning if necessary and serve." tag="recipes soup food nytimes winter" hash="fca6e61392cb60501da0abdf637cf17a" meta="f2fbdf522fe842b01525b0adb90a1bdd"    />
<post href="http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1016052/ribollita.html" time="2014-02-19T14:21:13Z" description="Ribollita" extended="&gt; INGREDIENTS
&gt; 
&gt; 5 tablespoons olive oil
&gt; 1 small onion, chopped
&gt; 1 carrot, chopped
&gt; 1 celery stalk, chopped
&gt; 1 tablespoon minced garlic
&gt; Salt and ground black pepper
&gt; 2 cups cooked or canned cannellini beans
&gt; 1 15-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
&gt; 4 cups vegetable stock or water
&gt; 1 fresh rosemary sprig
&gt; 1 fresh thyme sprig
&gt; 1 pound chopped kale or escarole
&gt; 4 large, thick slices whole-grain bread, toasted
&gt; 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
&gt; 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan
&gt; PREPARATION
&gt; 
&gt; 1.
&gt; Put 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pot over medium heat. When it’s hot, add onion, carrot, celery and garlic; sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, 5 to 10 minutes.
&gt; 2.
&gt; Heat the oven to 500 degrees. Drain the beans; if they’re canned, rinse them as well. Add them to the pot along with tomatoes and their juices and stock, rosemary and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat so the soup bubbles steadily; cover and cook, stirring once or twice to break up the tomatoes, until the flavors meld, 15 to 20 minutes.
&gt; 3.
&gt; Fish out and discard rosemary and thyme stems, if you like, and stir in kale. Taste and adjust seasoning. Lay bread slices on top of the stew so they cover the top and overlap as little as possible. Scatter red onion slices over the top, drizzle with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil and sprinkle with Parmesan.
&gt; 4.
&gt; Put the pot in the oven and bake until the bread, onions and cheese are browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. (If your pot fits under the broiler, you can also brown the top there.) Divide the soup and bread among 4 bowls and serve.

This router is part of the Tor Anonymity Network, which is dedicated to providing privacy to people who need it most: average computer users. This router IP should be generating no other traffic, unless it has been compromised.

Tor sees use by many important segments of the population, including whistle blowers, journalists, Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall and oppressive censorship, abuse victims, stalker targets, the US military, and law enforcement, just to name a few. While Tor is not designed for malicious computer users, it is true that they can use the network for malicious ends. In reality however, the actual amount of abuse is quite low. This is largely because criminals and hackers have significantly better access to privacy and anonymity than do the regular users whom they prey upon. Criminals can and do build, sell, and trade far larger and more powerful networks than Tor on a daily basis. Thus, in the mind of this operator, the social need for easily accessible censorship-resistant private, anonymous communication trumps the risk of unskilled bad actors, who are almost always more easily uncovered by traditional police work than by extensive monitoring and surveillance anyway.

In terms of applicable law, the best way to understand Tor is to consider it a network of routers operating as common carriers, much like the Internet backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Tor routers explicitly do not contain identifiable routing information about the source of a packet, and no single Tor node can determine both the origin and destination of a given transmission.

As such, there is little the operator of this router can do to help you track the connection further. This router maintains no logs of any of the Tor traffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or illegitimate traffic (or to filter one from the other). Attempts to seize this router will accomplish nothing.

Furthermore, this machine also serves as a carrier of email, which means that its contents are further protected under the ECPA. 18 USC 2707 explicitly allows for civil remedies ($1000/account plus legal fees) in the event of a seizure executed without good faith or probable cause (it should be clear at this point that traffic with an originating IP address of 93.184.66.227 should not constitute probable cause to seize the machine). Similar considerations exist for 1st amendment content on this machine.

If you are a representative of a company who feels that this router is being used to violate the DMCA, please be aware that this machine does not host or contain any illegal content. Also be aware that network infrastructure maintainers are not liable for the type of content that passes over their equipment, in accordance with DMCA &quot;safe harbor&quot; provisions. In other words, you will have just as much luck sending a takedown notice to the Internet backbone providers. Please consult EFF's prepared response for more information on this matter." tag="tor privacy internet security networks" hash="146b698b32b7fcf7a08fd92f1c1a8473" meta="930ac6a50a7f622d5fb1ab8636518535"    />

Try This" extended="As I’ve gotten a little into AngularJS I’ve been surprised by how often my assumptions about how things will work have turned out to be wrong. When you start to form a basic mental model of how Angular works and you hit your first stumbling block where your model turns out to be incorrect it can be really, really, frustrating. In particular I had one issue that kept cropping up so often I began trying it before running to Google for help if something wasn’t working the way I would have expected (all my views should just magically sync up with what’s on $scope, right?). This solution is to make sure $scope.$apply is getting used in the proper manner when updates to $scope are happening, especially if they are happening in unusual places e.g. inside of directives. Since I don’t really like “magical” or knee-jerk fixes to problems I highly recommend Jim Hoskins’s article on $scope.$apply which you can find here.

<post href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_Unfolding" time="2014-02-09T19:00:17Z" description="Planetary Unfolding" extended="&gt; Michael Stearns became a resident composer musician at Emily Conrad's meditation classes in 1975. He composed and performed at first on a Minimoog and various electro-acoustic instruments. In 1979, he was introduced to the Serge modular synthesizer by Kevin Braheny, who owned a 15-panels system (dubbed &quot;The Mighty Serge&quot;), which he used on Morning Jewel. He then built his own 12-panels Serge. On this one, as he already did with Braheny's system, he performed electronic music with a strong feeling of space.
&gt; Planetary Unfolding was recorded around 1981, when Michael left Conrad's Continuum Studio. Musical ideas that Michael performed on the Serge the previous years were put together and developed and gave birth to this 52 minute piece of music, with two parts each cut in three tracks.
&gt; The album was given a first release under Michael Stearns' own label, Continuum Montage, in 1981. It was reissued on CD from 1985 to 1991 by Sonic Atmospheres and is since unavailable: as of June 2009, it hasn't been reissued on Stearns's 2000-launched label Earth Turtle." tag="music wikipedia ambient synths records" hash="4e487ec81d19199400f447cfded69041" meta="db670c15cf65ee16b541e234a29a7cb3"    />

Since 1999, the music festival has been raging each year in the dusty Empire Polo Club of Indio, California. Each year I mildly look forward to the announcement of the line-up. What bands that I don't really care about will be named the &quot;headliners&quot;? What bands that I mildly like will be in much smaller type, in a strange order, that makes no sense based on either record sales or fan base or any other metric. Ooh, I'll think, finally, a festival where I can see both Mogwai and Girl Talk and Laura Mvula and maybe a flashback performance of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion! Sure, I'd totally love to see a set by The Magician. And Laurent Garnier! God I used to love Laurent Garnier. Also upon Googling, some of these other bands sound kind of okay.
&gt; 
&gt; But once again, this year, like every year that has come before, I'm definitely not going to Coachella. Seems really far. Seems kinda sweaty and tiring. Probably loud. Also I have access to all this music in my house.

If it moves, we track it. Sometimes we’ll draw a graph of something that isn’t moving yet, just in case it decides to make a run for it. In general, we tend to measure at three levels: network, machine, and application.

Application metrics are usually the hardest, yet most important, of the three. They’re very specific to your business, and they change as your applications change (and Etsy changes a lot). Instead of trying to plan out everything we wanted to measure and putting it in a classical configuration management system, we decided to make it ridiculously simple for any engineer to get anything they can count or time into a graph with almost no effort. (And, because we can push code anytime, anywhere, it’s easy to deploy the code too, so we can go from “how often does X happen?” to a graph of X happening in about half an hour, if we want to.)" tag="data programming nodejs infrastructure" hash="03fc1ef815b2f8df7b9f70b5dddfb815" meta="61e3fd681b8c556c84d5db9104b5f99b"    />

<post href="http://ursulakleguin.com/FAQ_Questionnaire5_01.html#EkumenBooks" time="2013-12-22T03:01:55Z" description="Ursula Le Guin - FAQ" extended="&gt; People write me nice letters asking what order they ought to read my science fiction books in — the ones that are called the Hainish or Ekumen cycle or saga or something. The thing is, they aren't a cycle or a saga. They do not form a coherent history. There are some clear connections among them, yes, but also some extremely murky ones. And some great discontinuities (like, what happened to &quot;mindspeech&quot; after Left Hand of Darkness? Who knows? Ask God, and she may tell you she didn't believe in it any more.)
&gt; OK, so, very roughly, then:
&gt; Rocannon's World, Planet of Exile, City of Illusions: where they fit in the &quot;Hainish cycle&quot; is anybody's guess, but I'd read them first because they were written first. In them there is a &quot;League of Worlds,&quot; but the Ekumen does not yet exist.
&gt; Then you could read The Word for World is Forest, The Left Hand of Darkness, The Dispossessed, in any order. In Dispossessed, the ansible gets invented; but they're using it in Left Hand, which was written fifteen years earlier. Please do not try to explain this to me. I will not understand.
&gt; Then in the collection of stories A Fisherman of the Inland Sea, the three last stories are Ekumenical, and we even finally find out a little about Hain, where it all began. The story suite Four Ways to Forgiveness is part of that universe, and so is the novel The Telling. But I have to warn you that the planet Werel in Four Ways is not the planet Werel in Planet of Exile. In between novels, I forget planets. Sorry.
&gt; The Eye of the Heron may or may not be set in the Hainish universe; it really doesn't matter. As for The Lathe of Heaven and Always Coming Home, my Terran science fiction novels, they definitely don't exist in the same universe as the Hainish or Ekumenical books.
&gt; While we're at it, Earthsea really does go in order, because it is all one story: A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan, The Farthest Shore, Tehanu, Tales from Earthsea, The Other Wind. (My British publisher insisted on doing the two last in the wrong order, and I'm very sorry about that, since &quot;Dragonfly&quot; in the Tales makes the bridge between Tehanu and The Other Wind.)
&gt; Catwings goes: Catwings, Catwings Return, Wonderful Alexander, and Jane On Her Own. (Since the publisher, Scholastic, seems to have some deep metaphysical objection to ever letting anybody sell the four books in the same place at the same time, go for the four-volume set — if you can find it.)" tag="books scifi" hash="016423113165808610f4f1a4844997d3" meta="bcfde03a079d4ec0a079367e73305354"    />

We know a fair bit about black holes , those dense remnants of dead stars that lie in the centre of galaxies whose gravitational pull is so strong that even light can’t escape them. But for all we know, astronomers have never recorded one’s creation; scientists typically study the after effects of this cosmic process. Until now. It turns out that a bright flash observed on April 27 of this year was actually a black hole forming. Called GRB 130427A, it’s already being touted as a watershed moment for astronomy. 

It might sound counterintuitive, but a star’s death is actually a dramatic and energetic event. As a star ages, the core that has provided its life-force for millions or billions of years runs out of fuel. This causes the star to collapse, and the act of imploding triggers a shockwave that blows up the star's outer layer. This is the bright supernova astronomers on Earth have seen from time to time for centuries. At the same time, the dying star shoots out a powerful blast of gamma-ray radiation.

While the star shoots out light and gamma-rays, its core shrinks and becomes steadily more dense. The increase in density has the effect of increasing the star’s core’s gravity to the point that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The border around that new black hole where the escape velocity is faster than the speed of light is called the event horizon. Whatever happens beyond that border we’ll never know. 

The recent observation is the first time a star's death and a black hole's birth has ever been recorded . Never before have a gamma-ray burst and its associated supernova explosion been measured simultaneously. This confluence of observations is unprecedented, and it comes thanks to a barrage of orbiting satellites working in tandem with ground based telescopes.

NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and Swift Gamma-ray Burst Mission were the first to detect the gamma-ray burst. They sent out an alert to observatories on the ground, including where to look (the constellation Leo). The Rapid Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) Project telescopes in Los Alamos, New Mexico, were quick to respond. These telescopes, which scan the sky for optical events like flashes from distant stars, are also designed to react quickly to capture astronomical phenomena as they happen. They quickly honed in on the blast and imaged the optical light, an event so bright (a magnitude 7 event on the astronomical brightness scale) that it could have been seen through simple binoculars. This optical measurement was complemented by the gamma-ray information gathered by Fermi and Swift, as well as x-ray data gathered by NASA’s NuSTAR mission.

The blast was more powerful than anything astronomers have ever seen. Right as the optical blast peaked, Fermi’s Large Area Telescope detected the largest spike in GeV gamma-rays ever recorded in association with an astronomical event like this — so big, astronomers thought it was theoretically impossible. As the gamma-ray burst subsided, so too did the optical light, leaving behind an afterglow akin to the embers of a dying fire. It’s another feature of these cosmic events astronomers have never before witnessed.

It’s the array of data types — optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray information — that has scientists so excited. Though astronomers have yet to really dig into the data, preliminary results are already challenging assumptions about the universe. Like the sheer brightness of the blast, for example. That GRB 130427A was so much brighter and more powerful than what astronomers thought was possible is forcing scientists to rethink existing theories of radiation to allow for these kinds of events. It’s also challenging the long-held theory that the light from supernovas come exclusively from an internal shockwave. GRB 130427A suggests that there might be an external shockwave at play, too. 

It’s too soon to say just how much this new data is going to change how we look at and understand the universe, but this is likely not the last we’ll hear about GRB 130427A." tag="" hash="be99bb290b59bb5999eed0a7e631e14e" meta="c40c63d06a4465f1315c96d1f616dabf"    />

<post href="http://matt.webb.usesthis.com/" time="2013-11-28T17:00:31Z" description="The Setup" extended="&gt; What would be your dream setup?
&gt; 
&gt; I used to live on the command-line, and I loved the ability to write my own software – to chain together functionality and write my own to create my own experience.
&gt; 
&gt; But either software’s harder than it was, apps and applications are less open to being hacked and recombined, or I’ve lost the knack.
&gt; 
&gt; It disappoints me that Excel hasn’t learnt from Python and Github and become a great environment for coding and modelling. It’s sad that there’s no plain text backend for Twitter, Foursquare and everything else I use. It’s annoying that Aperture owns all of my photos, and there’s no IMAP-like protocol for keeping my photos in the cloud forever, being able to hop between applications and code my own custom views and actions against an API.
&gt; 
&gt; I cut my teeth on the open web of the early 2000s. It was APIs, and mashups. Mac OS X turned my laptop into a web server and coding machine, just the same as where I hosted the toys and tools that I wrote. This is what the future was going to be like.
&gt; 
&gt; And then it didn’t happen. Code is fragile because APIs keep changing and nobody cares about scripting anymore. There are no text and image file formats anymore, practically speaking, because there’s no file interchange. Once photos are on Instagram, that’s it.
&gt; 
&gt; We’ve lost the ambition of the early web and early internet to create an inclusive, level playing field. It’s clear what the technical challenges are - HTTP needs micro-payments at the protocol level to support businesses outside advertising, we need portable high level standards for photos, streams and identity - but we’re kinda not thinking like that anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; So in reaction I stick with plain text as much as possible, and continue my computing life vaguely resenting the software world we’ve built.
&gt; 
&gt; That said, I’m a hypocrite. I’m not doing much about it (except that architecturally BERG Cloud is going to great lengths to avoid lock-in, and uses web APIs for integration), and ease of use trumps everything. Which means I use Apple all the way. So I’d love a fictional iPad Mini with a great display, a real keyboard for when I’m at the office, and a stylus for precision work. I’d like a camera that has Dropbox built-in. And I’d like to write code that deals with both of these. I’m not very good at writing code so it had better be easy.
&gt; 
&gt; So is that okay? My dream setup is an alternate global technical paradigm? There’s no point thinking small I guess." tag="python web api code interview" hash="9613419b504aa10dd1d021377d335a61" meta="a341dcc5dbff2eb9904401b88f9aed9d"    />

Aside from the novel flair of sleeping in a little and indulging in a larger-than-usual brunch, Sundays generally signify the slow death march towards the work week. This past summer, however, Sundays were different. At the behest of a friend and dance music enthusiast, he suggested a weekend pastime we'd been failing to participate in. From then on, a small army of us trekked out to Gowanus Grove on Sunday afternoons to go to Mister Sunday, the weekly party hosted by Eamon Harkin and Justin Carter.

Mister Sunday is only one of a few things keeping Harkin and Carter busy these days. In fact, their Sunday parties are a recent addition to the pair's dance-centric endeavors. In 2008, Harkin and Carter began throwing loft parties in Brooklyn under the Mister Saturday Night moniker. The outdoor daytime parties followed a year later. In addition to over 100 parties with guest spots from the likes of Theo Parrish, Ben UFO, Four Tet, and Moodymann, Mister Saturday Night is also a successful (and continuously growing) label, having released music by Anthony Naples, Archie Pelago, and most recently, Lumigraph. I chatted with one half of Mister Saturday Night to talk about the duo's history, cultivating a positive dance floor, and the challenges of New York real estate.

AH: You came to New York from Ireland about ten years ago. How did you get your foot in the door? 

EH: I came here and I didn’t know anybody. I had been DJing and throwing small parties in London. When I came here, my way of just being social and finding friends was to launch myself into going to parties. Musically my background at that point was more aligned with guitar music and less so of club music or electronic music. So I initially started going to parties that were more centered towards new wave and rock and roll and punk. There was quite a big scene at that time for that type of music. It was centered around a bunch of parties which were called Motherfucker . Do you know it?

A new Snowden leak sheds more light on Tailored Access Operations , a catalog of standard attacks against routers and other Internet infrastructure. 

The new leak details the deployment of malware against 50,000 computer networks worldwide , in cooperation with GCHQ, the British spy agency. The program dates back to 1998, and the infected networks are referred to internally as &quot;sleeper cells&quot; that can be switched on or off at will. Cyber operations are increasingly important for the NSA. Computer hacks are relatively inexpensive and provide the NSA with opportunities to obtain information that they otherwise would not have access to. The NSA-presentation shows their CNE-operations in countries such as Venezuela and Brazil. The malware installed in these countries can remain active for years without being detected. ‘Sleeper cells’ can be activated with a single push of a button 

The malware can be controlled remotely and be turned on and off at will. The ‘implants’ act as digital ‘sleeper cells’ that can be activated with a single push of a button. According to the Washington Post, the NSA has been carrying out this type of cyber operation since 1998.

&gt; About 2 hours, plus 1 1/2 hours’ chilling
&gt; 
&gt; YIELD
&gt; 8 servings
&gt; 
&gt; INGREDIENTS
&gt; For the crust:
&gt; 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (150 grams)
&gt; 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
&gt; 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, preferably a high-fat European style, cold and cut into cubes
&gt; 2 to 4 tablespoons ice water, as needed
&gt; 
&gt; FOR THE FILLING
&gt; 1 3/4 cups squash or pumpkin purée (see note)
&gt; 3 large eggs
&gt; 1 cup heavy cream
&gt; 3/4 cup dark brown sugar (153 grams)
&gt; 2 tablespoons brandy
&gt; 2 teaspoons ground ginger (4 grams)
&gt; 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon (3 grams)
&gt; 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (3 grams)
&gt; 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
&gt; Pinch ground clove
&gt; PREPARATION
&gt; Make the crust: In a food processor, pulse together the flour and salt. Add butter and pulse until the mixture forms chickpea-size pieces. Add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse until the dough just comes together. It should be moist, but not wet. On a lightly floured surface, gather the dough into a ball. Flatten into a disk with the heel of your hand. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.
&gt; On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to a 12-inch circle. Transfer crust to a 9-inch pie plate. Fold over any excess dough, then crimp edges. Prick crust all over with a fork. Chill crust for 30 minutes.
&gt; While the dough chills, heat oven to 375 degrees. Line chilled crust with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 20 minutes; remove foil and weights and bake until pale golden, 5 to 7 minutes more. Cool on rack until needed.
&gt; Lower oven temperature to 325 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin purée, eggs, cream, dark brown sugar, brandy, ginger, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the nutmeg and clove. Pour mixture into the cooled pie shell. Transfer pie to a large baking sheet. Bake until crust is golden and center jiggles just slightly when shaken, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool completely before serving.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: To make butternut squash purée, peel, halve and seed a 2 1/2- to 3-pound squash and cut flesh into 1 1/2-inch chunks. Coat with melted butter or oil and roast at 400 degrees, stirring once or twice, until the squash is tender, about 30 to 45 minutes. Let cool, then purée in a food processor." tag="pie recipes food thanksgiving dessert" hash="89511b013e2d52aede90442c92ffb2f9" meta="95352de606274738f9d4c94be437d614"    />

It draws you in. You could believe in it more... Everyone goes on about themselves, they reveal everything and give it away...They should just hold back a bit, it's sexier.&quot; 

- Burial, in a 2012 interview with The Wire 

Most genres of music have, at one time or another, been accused of sexism, of creating spaces where women felt either unwelcome or uncomfortable participating. The riot grrrl movement was all about bringing the girls out from hiding in the world of punk, encouraging them to make the leap from holding their boyfriend’s coat to holding the mic. The realm of electronic music is arguably lagging behind the rock world in terms of addressing gender politics, and even in today’s supposedly post-feminist climate, dance music can seem like an alienating place for a woman. Maybe this is because producing requires the sort of technological expertise that has often been gendered in our society as male.

Or perhaps it has to do with the cold anonymity of the DJ/producer figure, seemingly antithetical to female identity, which is invariably tied up with possessing an image and a clear-cut sexuality. The typical female pop star is marketed to be either sweet and innocent or wild and slutty-- and when she jumps from one side to the other, people experience the shift as appalling . Debates over how much skin woman can reveal, over the rigid rules of what is classy and what is trashy, have been going on for a long time, but the fighting over these rules seems only to legitimize their validity in the first place. In electronic music, which has traditionally been less centered on an artist's physical presence, the listener can't make snap judgments about the woman involved, and thus has to acknowledge her complexity. But despite these challenges, females in electronic music do exist. Earlier this year, Grimes described some of the conflicts surrounding being a female who also makes music in a Tumblr post , pointing out the way women in the music industry are routinely characterized by the same rigid virgin/whore binary that permeates the rest of mainstream society. &quot;I don't want to be infantalized because I refuse to be sexualized,&quot; she writes in the second line of the piece. Female producers, like other female musicians, have struggled to achieve the same recognition that their male counterparts do, to be seen and heard apart from the way they look.

The worst part about our headlong trudge to the tomb is the way that once we realize how much road is already behind us it is far too late to go back and fix the mistakes we made along the way. Maybe the best bit about life—and I am setting an admittedly low bar here, but look what we have to deal with—is that although we are always tempted to pinpoint specific instances where the decisions we made had irrevocable effects on our trajectory from that moment forward, if we are honest with ourselves we can admit that, for the most part, we were going to wind up exactly where we did no matter what. We are who we are and the choices we make are the results of those immutable traits that add up to the person who, for better or worse and usually worse, stares back at us in the mirror each morning with a mixture of pity and astonishment. If we could turn back time we would mostly make the same mistakes, maybe at different moments but always moving us in the same direction. You've fucked up your life through an accretion of small details, not by one or two enormous errors. It is pointless to pine for a do-over; you would just do it over badly. That is who you are and at some point you will have to make peace with it. That said, you do have a chance this weekend to go back in time and do things differently, but it happens at 2 AM Sunday morning and, if you are not sleeping through it, you will almost certainly be ensconced in a bad decision you won't be able to do anything to alter with the extra hour you get. That's the way life works. It's what happens when you're busy finding ways to fuck things up for yourself. Death will probably be a relief." tag="time life lol" hash="18a3bdd1b04e5f9622ed1e524080ba7b" meta="78e3dd1c6e8181afda5b29391894b22e"    />

It was August 1991, and a No. 4 train had just derailed under Union Square in New York City in one of the deadliest mass transit accidents in the city's history. Subway operator Glenn Rowe had finished his shift on the day of the accident, when his brother, a work train operator for the MTA, called to say he had to work the salvage shift at the wreck. Would Rowe like to come along?

Rowe grabbed his camera, fastened his work vest and hurried to the abandoned 18th Street Lexington Avenue station. When he arrived, he flashed his employment pass to supervisors at the scene and pushed his way through to a clear position on the nearby platform, where he took some of the first photographs ever taken of the wreck.

Union Square accident, 1991. Glenn Rowe. 

The photos could have amounted to tawdry voyeurism. Instead, Rowe managed to capture the gravity and the ghostly commotion of New York’s subway workers at the scene of a tragedy. After all, Rowe is a seasoned photographer: he belongs to a club of sorts of current and former transit workers who double as secret, eloquent photographers of the trains and systems they operate.

In the 1970s and 1980s, they documented the grimy, graffiti-covered subways where vigilante Guardian Angels squared off against thugs. Today, they snap mint-new cars with automated messages and light-up signs. Taken together, their thousands of photographs are an homage to New York’s subway system.

&quot;Most people do it because they’re enthusiasts,&quot; says Nick DiBari, a photographer and dispatcher for several MTA subway lines. &quot;They want to have a record of it for future generations. You work with the equipment, you start to get attached to it.&quot;

No one knows exactly how many transit photographers are out there, but at least 20 current and former subway operators, dispatchers and conductors showed up to the 13th Annual Mass Transit &amp; Trolley Modeler's Convention , held at Rutgers University’s Student Center in early October, to buy and sell their transit-related photographs and memorabilia.

Franklin Avenue shuttle, 1975. Steve Zabel. 

Arrayed on dozens of tables in two large halls of the student center were old bus, trolley, train and subway maps, miniature transit models, subway roll signs, slides, vintage tickets, expired MetroCards, bus change collector machines and reams upon reams of photos from all eras by dozens of photographers.

Most of the photos had labels that detailed the date the shot was taken, the model of the subway car, the photographer, and often the car's serial number, the station, and an explanatory note.

While many subway shots document trains as a matter of plain historical fact, some are extraordinary. In one 1982 photo, a graffiti-scarred behemoth pulls in to Brooklyn’s Avenue H station over snowy tracks. In another photo taken during rush hour at a grimy Grand Central in 1981, a woman peers out the front window of a muscular model R-36 7 train, draped in shadow, the fenders and her hair brightly outlined chiaroscuro-like.

Avenue H, 1982. Michael Piselli. 

Many of the shots hint at incredible narratives. During the World Series in New York in 2000, Rowe found out that Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton—mayor and senator at the time—were on the same 7 train headed for Shea Stadium. Rowe trailed the train, then used his employee pass to get into the Corona Park subway yards to shoot the rare Subway Series redbird that had just transported the politicians to Game 3.

Some photos are taken from operators' cabins as they drive, which is technically against MTA rules. Subway operators have even been known to ask their dispatcher, who controls the light signals on the track, to halt their train while they run out of their trains to take the perfect shot.

At the transit convention, non-transit-employee hobbyists wandered among transit workers, and older retirees caught up with old friends from their MTA days. Carlton Bridges has been a subway operator since 1985, but coincidentally, he was Glenn Rowe’s partner for a year before that, conducting the same A train Rowe was operating. Bridges's job as a conductor was to inform passengers which station they had arrived at. He joked around with Rowe beside his display table.

&quot;I was the highest quality conductor,&quot; says Bridges. &quot;I spoke the Queen’s English.&quot; He leans toward an iPhone like it's the microphone in a conductor's cabin. &quot;Station-stop is 59th street. 59th street. Yeah, that’s the way I would say it. Station-stop. Because it was a station-stop, you know what I mean? Station-stop is 34th street. Station-stop is 34th.&quot;

At another table, Anthony Errante, a former subway operator, marveled at photos by Joe Saitta, an older photographer who recently died. &quot;That’s in East New York,&quot; says Errante, pointing to a black and white photo of an elevated line with a steel girder hanging above the tracks. &quot;They were going to build an express track above it, but they never got to it.&quot;

There are a few names well-known in transit enthusiasts' circles to be among the most prolific photographers: Mike Piselli, Ed McKernan and Rowe, among others. But perhaps the most notorious subway photographer is the legendary Steve Zabel, a subway operator who was active in the 1970s and 1980s.

There are stories of Zabel halting his train, changing the cars' roll signs to display a different subway line, and then getting out and taking shots, much to the confusion of his passengers. Zabel used to lie down on the track bed or wait atop well-situated buildings above elevated lines to capture the most auspicious angles. Nearly everyone who collects has at least a few Zabels.

&quot;Steve would climb halfway up a light pole to take a good shot. I’ve got a lot of slides from his collection,&quot; says Rowe. &quot;He was a great photographer.&quot;

The subway operators who are still taking photos said their interest began in childhood and never disappeared. They reminisced about early trips in the operators’ cabins with relatives, and watching the subways roll by on elevated lines outside their windows.

&quot;The first word I learned was probably 'train,'&quot; Bridges says. &quot;When I see little kids watching me operating in the cabin, I know they’re awed, just like I was awed.&quot;" tag="" hash="1bdd82694a657a3b28f96f1034a3233a" meta="5315ad5e2440c0866d9377f104247cd0"    />

<post href="http://remysharp.com/2013/10/22/a-self-destructive-web/" time="2013-10-22T12:39:55Z" description="A self destructive web" extended="I’m finding myself more and more nowadays interested in content that self destructs , or rather: expires after time and will no longer exist.

This post is more me dropping my thoughts on a page rather than having fully explored the idea (yet). Please note this post is also unedited (which I may use to my advantage and edit over time…we’ll see).

Saving is “forever”? 
From an early age I’ve played and worked with computers. I always understood that I was creating programs that would be saved .

That simple idea of saving, be it to a physical tape (I was a Spectrum user) or fast forward to the 90s when I published my first web pages – it was simply naughts and ones and since it was stored digitally†, it could be copied over and over. When it was on a server, all it needed is the server to stay plugged in or even cached on another server and boom, you’ve just unlocked forever .

† Sure, the tape drive wasn’t digital, but you’ll forgive me. 

But the simple fact is: we have to make an effort to preserve. Server drives crash, data gets lost, companies disappear (my first site was on lineone.net if anyone remember that – now long gone), domains expire and people die.

So what is forever ? Maybe there’s an unspoken expiry? But when the expiry is in decades I feel like I conflate this with forever. I don’t feel like the web community has been going long enough to see that long expiry showing it’s face. Maybe we’ve got another 20-30 years to go.

Should it last forever? 
I was just looking at Stef Lewandowski’s tweet about their new hack Linkydin . A nice idea, but I was asking myself: surely these links have context in time .

If you’re sharing a group of links in a team, should that information expire? What good is it a year (or more) later to new team members, and in fact could it share old and busted knowledge that’s been superceeded by better information? I don’t know .

Then I read Paul Neave’s post “Why I create for the web” and he boils it down to the humble hyperlink. Except the way I found his post was through a tweet. A tweet that a) I will unlikely find again (because twitter’s archive search is limited) and b) goes through twitter’s own link shortening service. If that service is shut down, then that hyperlink is sent to the grave (note that this isn’t the point of @neave’s post – but it got me thinking).

I recently looked at Snapchat. Content that purposely destroys itself, I can only assume, because it’s relevant for that moment †. I also remember someone having a blog that would slowly remove all the blog posts one at a time over a period of time (and it would look like the articles were fading out at the bottom of the site).

† Though Snapchat might not destroy the data on the phone it is actually removed from their server, which, to me, means it’ll expire from existence somehow eventually. 

I like these later two because they’ve thought specifically about time and how it should be addressed. My own blog, I haven’t thought about time. I haven’t thought about whether it’ll shutdown after I die. I’ve long stopped posting to jQuery for Designers but I’ll keep the domain renewed…but for how long? 

Should sites be retired to the archive.org? 

I don’t know. A lot of these questions are why I’ve asked Jeremy Keith to speak at Full Frontal whereby he chose the title “Time”. I expect he’ll add a lot of clarity to some of my thoughts, but no doubt raise a good deal of new questions.

Everything ends 
Everything has an expiry. Nothing lasts forever, but maybe my expectations need to adjust on the web. If something lasts a few years on the web that’s a good thing. If I can get my data out of a web service, then that’s a good thing too (because I’m now responsible for my content, like photos which I care about).

I’m just very interested in seeing more services taking advantage of expiry as a feature. Heck, we buy and own (small) pets because the expiry is a feature! Why don’t we use this more on the web?

Ms. Kolesnikova’s family bathes once a month now in bad weather, and the house smells mossy. The road is so derelict that no strangers pass through — this much is evident from the rapt stares of her towheaded sons. They have grown up deep in the forest.
&gt; 
&gt; Ms. Kolesnikova is not leaving, though. Asked why, she gave an answer that would resonate with any Russian: The air is clean. They gather berries and mushrooms in the summer. They produce their own cottage cheese and sour cream. “Everything is ours,” she said.
&gt; 
&gt; And yet the risks rise from year to year. Last spring, when the mud was so deep that “we lived as if we were on an island,” she and her neighbors appealed to the local prosecutor. They argued that the state was obliged to keep the roads passable year-round, if only for the safety of the last souls who remain in this wood.
&gt; 
&gt; They received an answer, on official letterhead, and the answer was no." tag="russia nature cities future history nytimes" hash="1d5c740061dbdcd07aa93e5a794c7a8c" meta="0dea7942a02e4827b14b2affd46508ba"    />

&gt; The way we consume the visual arts is constantly changing, and the internet has helped to democratise the consumption of art. With the transformation of the Rijksmuseum over the past ten years, we had the opportunity to digitise the collection and realise a dream to make it available online to as wide an audience as possible. It can now be enjoyed by people across the world, and gives them the possibility of engaging with our extensive collection even if they do not have the ability to travel to Amsterdam. Rijks Studio also allows us to showcase works that might not be seen to the public otherwise.

<post href="https://sayhi.co/moments/61ph7h26" time="2013-10-14T23:46:15Z" description="Pull back, San Francisco, United States - sayhi.co" extended="&gt; I want them all to slow down. I want to whisper in their ears: pull back for a second. Just for a moment. Stop and refine. Refine and refine.
&gt; 
&gt; Refinement is hard because it requires faith. Faith in the thing you’re refining — that the process of refinement will yield greater value; or faith that there is any value in the thing to begin with. To refine is some parts hubris, other parts humility, all parts vulnerability.
&gt; 
&gt; If you release the unrefined thing into the world and it doesn’t do well, you can always tell yourself: Ah, if only I had refined, it would have been great.
&gt; 
&gt; To leave something important to you unrefined — uniterated, firstdrafted — is the laziest safety net you can deploy. It’s almost lazier than not creating in the first place. It’s also mean to those around you. Few things are meaner than foisting a lazy draft of a novel upon friends.
&gt; 
&gt; Creation without refinement is a vicious loop. When the unrefined thing fails or falters, you tell yourself it isn’t worth refining anymore. And so you move onto the next thing. You build something else. You draft and release another thing sans refinement. And so on, and so forth.
&gt; 
&gt; To have faith in refinement, though, endows one with a certain private glory. There is a warmth found in the peeling back of rough onion layers to find that thing you felt but couldn’t produce on first blush.
&gt; 
&gt; In the process of refinement lies also meditations. A calm meditation like that found in sanding a hulking wooden table by hand, slowly, over the course of a week. Or it can be a restive meditation filled with resignation — resignation to the need to rebuild and remake and possibly start over.
&gt; 
&gt; In refinement and iteration you finally get to know the thing you made. Really know it. Understand how bad it is. How great it could be. How much potential is still left unrealized. And within each iteration you move the thing forward; sometimes better, sometimes worse.
&gt; 
&gt; But first you have to stop. If just for a moment.
&gt; 
&gt; And so I keep whispering to all of them as I walk down the street: pull back and refine and refine." tag="work programming life advice building" hash="2b5c3eba1c369968dc06522ac817d9df" meta="6e2a3ad1aab218f244489d5983d66ed7"    />

&gt; So there’s this project I’ve been wanting to make for a long time that takes a while to build all the pieces, and JS Git is a large bit of it. I want to make a developer environment for kids so that they can learn how to program on whatever device they have available, whether that be a Chromebook or their iPad or whatever computing device that has enough power. Most kids don’t always get a full-on laptop, but they often have a powerful enough device. And these are all restricted consumer environments that are not really ideal for developing. So, Git is one big piece of this so that they can import and export code and collaborate with others on the internet, because I think learning how to do open source is a good part of learning to program, and you can learn how to work with others. Also, more than just JS Git, this app will have things like, on platforms that are supported, being able to UDP where it can auto-detect other instances of the app. So you could have a workshop full of kids with Chromebooks, and they can see each other’s laptops without any configuration at all. They can just spawn local Git servers on their laptops and share with each other or spawn a local HTTP server and play each other’s web apps or whatever that they want, and yeah, it’s just a part of that. It’s just a part that no one’s really built the way I want and it takes a while. That’s why I made such a big project out of it." tag="javascript git programming education" hash="c533c74fe398bcf1ed581e8e38ffc95d" meta="e5e3735447a697bc6be1f591d089a32e"    />

<post href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Memory_of_Elizabeth_Reed" time="2013-09-28T20:42:45Z" description="In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" extended="&gt; In this performance, taken from the March 13, 1971 (first show) concert by the group,[10] Betts opens the song with ethereal volume swells on his guitar, giving the aural impression of violins.[11][12] Slowly the first theme begins to emerge, Duane Allman's guitar joining Betts in a dual lead that variously doubles the melody,[13] provides a harmony line,[14] or provides counterpoint.[13] The tempo then picks up in the next section[12] to a Santana-like,[2] quasi-Latin beat, a strong second-theme melody driven by unison playing and harmonized guitars arising.[9]
&gt; Betts next solos[11][12] from the start of the second theme.[15] This leads into an organ solo from Gregg Allman, with the two guitars playing rhythm figures in the background. Throughout, percussionists Butch Trucks and Jai Johanny Johanson play in unison, laying what has been described as &quot;a thick bed of ride-snare rhythm for the soloists to luxuriate upon.&quot;[16]
&gt; Duane Allman then[12] starts quietly rephrasing the first theme, gradually building to a high-pitched climax, Berry Oakley's bass guitar playing a strong counterpoint against the band's trademark percussion. Allman cools into a reverie, then starts again, finding an even more furious peak.[15] Parts of this solo would draw comparison to John Coltrane and his sheets of sound,[15] other parts to Miles Davis' classic Kind of Blue album. Duane Allman biographer Randy Poe wrote that &quot;[Allman]'s playing jazz in a rock context&quot; reflected the emerging jazz fusion movement, only in reverse.[12] Allman himself told writer Robert Palmer at that time, &quot;that kind of playing comes from Miles and Coltrane, and particularly Kind of Blue. I've listened to that album so many times that for the past couple of years, I haven't hardly listened to anything else.&quot;[12] Almost two decades later, Palmer would write of the Allmans, &quot;that if the musicians hadn't quite scaled Coltrane-like heights, they had come as close as any rock band was likely to get.&quot;[17] Rolling Stone would say in 2002 that the song's performance found the musicians &quot;lock[ed] together ... with the grace and passion of the tightest jazz musicians,&quot;[18] while in 2008, it said the trills, crawls, and sustain of the guitar work represented &quot;the language of jazz charged with electric R&amp;B futurism.&quot;[9]
&gt; Following the Duane Allman solo the band drops off to a relatively brief but to-the-point percussion break by Trucks and Johanson reflecting Kind of Blue drummer Jimmy Cobb's work.[12] The full band then enters to recap the mid-tempo second theme, finishing the song abruptly.[12] Several silent beats pass before the Fillmore audience erupts in riotous applause.[12]" tag="music jazz rock instrumentals improvisation rad allmanbros 70s" hash="3a8ea1ed349f3937e55bbda6e8b00f94" meta="70e30b5cc906f71874a3111380b02cb0"    />

I explained this to Kurt but I thought I'd better reiterate it here. I do not want and will not take a royalty on any record I record. No points. Period. I think paying a royalty to a producer or engineer is ethically indefensible. The band write the songs. The band play the music. It's the band's fans who buy the records. The band is responsible for whether it's a great record or a horrible record. Royalties belong to the band.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to be paid like a plumber: I do the job and you pay me what it's worth. The record company will expect me to ask for a point or a point and a half. If we assume three million sales, that works out to 400,000 dollars or so. There's no fucking way I would ever take that much money. I wouldn't be able to sleep.
&gt; 
&gt; I have to be comfortable with the amount of money you pay me, but it's your money, and I insist you be comfortable with it as well. Kurt suggested paying me a chunk which I would consider full payment, and then if you really thought I deserved more, paying me another chunk after you'd had a chance to live with the album for a while. That would be fine, but probably more organizational trouble than it's worth.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever. I trust you guys to be fair to me and I know you must be familiar with what a regular industry goon would want. I will let you make the final decision about what I'm going to be paid. How much you choose to pay me will not effect my enthusiasm for the record.
&gt; 
&gt; Some people in my position would expect an increase in business after being associated with your band. I, however, already have more work that I can handle, and frankly, the kind of people such superficialities will attract are not people I want to work with.

Tricky says: &quot;Andy Stott remix was done just because he is a talent, no other reason. This is not for a single release and not promotion for any up and coming release. We approached him and asked him to choose a song. False Idols is not a typical label so we do not have to do things in typical label fashion. Andy Stott's remix is totally pure and refreshing and stands alone.&quot; US Tour 2013: 10/1/2013 Philadelphia, PA -- Union Transfer 10/2/2013 New York, NY -- Webster Hall 10/3/2013 Boston, MA -- Royale 10/5/2013 Washington, DC -- U Street Music Hall 10/6/2013 Toronto, ON -- The Mod Club 10/8/2013 Minneapolis, MN -- First Avenue 10/9/2013 Chicago, IL -- Metro 10/10/2013 Milwaukee, WI -- Turner Hall Ballroom 10/12/2013 Dallas, TX -- House of Blues 10/13/2013 Houston, TX -- House of Blues 10/14/2013 Austin, TX -- Emo's 10/16/2013 Lawrence, Kansas Granada Theater 10/17/2013 Denver, CO -- Gothic Theatre 10/19/2013 San Francisco, CA -- Treasure Island Music Festival 10/23/2013 Los Angeles, CA -- El Rey 10/25/2013 Asheville, NC -- Mountain Oasis Electronic Music Summit 'Nothings's Changed' available for FREE download NOW: http://www.trickysite.com/sign-up/" tag="youtube" hash="fa877cafc4d31d9f676ac7ff6536b6f2" meta="e4c1ab0272389056877d29e22f81c7c0"    />

Data is spilling over the walls of science and business and into the humanities, and journalism, and civics. I think those of us so engaged are abandoning our reliance on voices of authority, and taking up these tools ourselves, and I think that’s good, and important. But at the moment, we seem to be grasping for absolutes, as though part of an empiricist cargo-cult ritual; we crave a number, any number, even if we don’t understand it, so long as it looks precise. And because we have access to very precise-looking data, we feel obliged to represent it precisely.
&gt; This obsession with nominal accuracy, and its conflation with realism, completely misses so many interesting ways to comprehend and explore more complex ideas – maybe even in simpler forms, and maybe even more truthfully. I’d like to see what happens if we allow the data to fit to a human scale, while being open and honest about where it comes from, and what happens to it along the way." tag="maps mountains representation visualization data" hash="64e72df8beb54de52b4af314b69cef39" meta="dd1049102120eab82747ab034f5d06f6"    />

The borough’s a patchwork of the old and new, but traces of its history aren’t spread evenly. There are 320,000-odd buildings in Brooklyn, and I’ve plotted and shaded each of them according to its year of construction. The result is a snapshot of Brooklyn’s evolution, revealing how development has rippled across certain neighborhoods while leaving some pockets unchanged for decades, even centuries." tag="maps visualization brooklyn nyc history" hash="7da3a87ba089bbe37abb1b9f308988ae" meta="3465116df8610f0a1b27deabfe81e17c"    />

&gt; 
&gt; 290 grams all-purpose flour (about 2 1/2 cups), more for rolling out dough
&gt; 35 grams cornmeal (about 1/4 cup)
&gt; 35 grams sugar (about 3 tablespoons)
&gt; 2 grams salt (about 1/2 teaspoon)
&gt; 12 tablespoons butter, unsalted, chilled, cut into small cubes
&gt; 1/4 cup vegetable shortening, chilled, cut into small pieces
&gt; 
&gt; FOR THE FILLING:
&gt; 135 grams granulated sugar (about 3/4 cup)
&gt; 30 grams cornstarch (about 1/4 cup)
&gt; 1/8 teaspoon salt
&gt; 1 lemon, zested and juiced
&gt; 6 cups fresh blueberries (about 3 pints)
&gt; 2 tablespoons milk
&gt; 1 tablespoon Demerara or raw sugar
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Make the crust: blend flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt in a food processor. Add butter and shortening, then pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 4 tablespoons ice water and blend until dough forms a ball, adding more ice water, a half-tablespoon at a time (up to 2 additional tablespoons), if dough is dry. Divide dough in half, flatten into two round disks, wrap in plastic and chill at least 1 hour.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, make the filling: whisk together sugar, cornstarch, salt and lemon zest. Fold in 4 cups blueberries, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon water. Let stand at room temperature about 45 minutes until juices form. Gently fold in the remaining 2 cups blueberries.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Heat oven to 400 degrees. On a floured surface, roll out one dough round. Transfer rolled-out dough to a 9-inch pie pan and fill with blueberry mixture. Roll out the second dough round, then use it to cover the pie, decoratively crimping together dough edges to seal. Score top crust with a knife so pie can vent. Brush with milk and sprinkle with Demerara sugar.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Place pie pan on a rimmed cookie sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue baking until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling, about 35 minutes more. Spoon any escaped juices onto pie. Transfer to a rack and cool completely before serving." tag="cooking recipes pie fruit summer food blueberries" hash="06271e372cc375ec590a0cc59b8396dc" meta="16ea7a1bb7bdd0ae40fe737a2b327b6b"    />

&gt; 
&gt; For the peanut vinaigrette: 
&gt; ½ cup peanut oil
&gt; 2 Tablespoons toasted sesame oil
&gt; 2 Tablespoons seasoned rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)
&gt; 1 Tablespoon soy sauce
&gt; 1-½ Tablespoons honey
&gt; Dash of cayenne pepper
&gt; 
&gt; For the salad: 
&gt; 4 heaping cups chopped kale (from one smallish bunch kale, leaves washed and de-stemmed)
&gt; 1 cup finely slivered green cabbage
&gt; ¼ cup chopped fresh mint
&gt; ¼ cup chopped cilantro
&gt; 1 scallion, slivered
&gt; 3 Tablespoons chopped peanuts (I use roasted salted peanuts)
&gt; 
&gt; Make the dressing by whisking all the ingredients together in a small mixing bowl. Alternately, you can add the ingredients to a small jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake vigorously to combine. 
&gt; 
&gt; Combine all the salad ingredients except the chopped peanuts in a large bowl. Add about half the dressing and toss well, adding more dressing as needed so that all the leaves are lightly coated. (You will probably have leftover dressing.) This salad tastes better if dressed at least 30 minutes before serving, giving the vinaigrette a chance to mellow out the crunch of the raw kale leaves. 
&gt; 
&gt; Add the chopped peanuts right before serving and toss again, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Makes 4 salad servings, or 2 main course servings." tag="recipes food salad kale thai" hash="ff669d59f767879677e770537e9b33eb" meta="1d1e3315e719f2bd1c62a035794e0e69"    />

This is completely untrue! npm actually stands for Node Packaged Modules, e.g. modules that Node packages together for you. The modules themselves can be whatever you want -- they are just a folder of files wrapped up in a .tar.gz, and a file called package.json that declares the module version and a list of all modules that are dependencies of the module (as well as their version numbers so the working versions get installed automatically). It's turtles all the way down - module dependencies are just modules, and those modules can have dependencies etc. etc. etc.

&gt; 
&gt; INGREDIENTS
&gt; ½ cup flour
&gt; 1 (3-lb.) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces
&gt; Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
&gt; 2 slices bacon, roughly chopped
&gt; 3 tbsp. olive oil
&gt; 5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
&gt; 1 cup chicken stock
&gt; ½ cup dry sherry
&gt; 2 tbsp. roughly chopped parsley
&gt; 2 tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into ¼&quot; cubes
&gt; Country bread, for serving
&gt; 
&gt; INSTRUCTIONS
&gt; 1. Heat oven to 350°. Place flour in a bowl; set aside. Season chicken with salt and pepper, and dredge in flour; set aside. Heat bacon in a 12&quot; ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, and cook, stirring, until its fat renders, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a bowl; set aside. Add oil to skillet, and working in 2 batches, add chicken, and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Add garlic to the skillet, and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add stock and sherry, and return chicken to the skillet, skin-side up; sprinkle with reserved bacon along with parsley, and then dot with butter. Transfer skillet to oven, and cook, basting twice during cooking, until chicken is cooked through and tender, about 40 minutes; serve with country bread." tag="recipes food cooking chicken" hash="5d575866c2ab78182ffe77a639e4b982" meta="cc9212115e2efda08d70b87eb7f4296e"    />

- Fast lookups: A successful lookup in a large database normally takes just two disk accesses. An unsuccessful lookup takes only one.
- Low overhead: A database uses 2048 bytes, plus 24 bytes per record, plus the space for keys and data.
- No random limits: cdb can handle any database up to 4 gigabytes. There are no other restrictions; records don't even have to fit into memory. Databases are stored in a machine-independent format.
- Fast atomic database replacement: cdbmake can rewrite an entire database two orders of magnitude faster than other hashing packages.
- Fast database dumps: cdbdump prints the contents of a database in cdbmake-compatible format." tag="data database programming tablethotels" hash="d4cba9c8119097488bc10182cdd3e030" meta="956cd521fc7d2767f12bf3f6da7e1163"    />

One complaint per table is all, unless you want them to spit in the food. Let me tell you a story about George Jean Nathan, America’s great drama critic. Nathan was the tightest man who ever lived, even tighter than Charles Chaplin. And he lived for 40 years in the Hotel Royalton, which is across from the Algonquin. He never tipped anybody in the Royalton, not even when they brought the breakfast, and not at Christmastime. After about ten years of never getting tipped, the room-service waiter peed slightly in his tea. Everybody in New York knew it but him. The waiters hurried across the street and told the waiters at Algonquin, who were waiting to see when it would finally dawn on him what he was drinking! And as the years went by, there got to be more and more urine and less and less tea. And it was a great pleasure for us in the theater to look at a leading critic and know that he was full of piss. And I, with my own ears, heard him at the ‘21’ complaining, saying, “Why can’t I get tea here as good as it is at the Royalton?” That’s when I fell on the floor, you know." tag="hollywood interview movies" hash="8098984381b56f8c0d8de443b88229be" meta="1bfe6eb78efd9c16249bcb3bf3e3a5a9"    />

In a finite continued fraction (or terminated continued fraction), the iteration/recursion is terminated after finitely many steps by using an integer in lieu of another continued fraction. In contrast, an infinite continued fraction is an infinite expression. In either case, all integers in the sequence, other than the first, must be positive. The integers ai are called the coefficients or terms of the continued fraction." tag="math wikipedia algorithm" hash="2c1ef07fa17d6e5130a5bd04cc6cf544" meta="d940d62dd88aa6d8d1b9f70f785614a8"    />

&gt; Serves 6-8
&gt; 
&gt; Anissa’s recipe uses plenty of flat-leaved parsley. When shopping, if weighing them, each bunch I bought weighed between 3 to 4 ounces, or 85 to 115 grams, but if you want to be certain, simply weigh them at the market so you know you have the amount called for in the recipe. Once home, pick the parsley and mint leaves from the stems and wash them in a salad spinner. -dl
&gt;
&gt; INGREDIENTS
&gt;
&gt; 3 tablespoons (30g) fine bulgur
&gt; 3 medium (600g) firm ripe tomatoes, diced into small cubes
&gt; 2 (50g) spring onions or scallions, trimmed and very thinly sliced
&gt; 14 ounces (400g) flat-leaf parsley, most of the stalks discarded, leaves washed and dried
&gt; 2 cups (20g) mint leaves (no stems), washed and dried
&gt; 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
&gt; 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice (or Lebanese seven-spice mixture)
&gt; 1/4 teaspoon finely ground black pepper
&gt; salt to taste
&gt; juice of 1 lemon, or to taste
&gt; 2/3 cup (150ml) extra virgin olive oil
&gt; 4 gem lettuce heads, washed and quartered
&gt; 
&gt; DIRECTIONS
&gt;
&gt; 1.Rinse the bulgur in several changes of cold water. Drain well and put in a bowl. Stir it with a fork every now and then to help it fluff up.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.Put the diced tomatoes in a bowl and set aside while you prepare the herbs. A word of warning: do not chop the herbs with a mezzaluna. This will only bruise them.
&gt; 
&gt; Using a razor-sharp knife, grab as much of the parsley and mint as you can handle in a bunch, and slice them very thin, to end up with nice, crisp slender strips.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.Drain the tomatoes of their juice and put in a large bowl. Add the spring onion and herbs. Sprinkle the bulgur all over. Season with the cinnamon, allspice and pepper. Add salt to taste. Add the lemon juice and olive oil and mix well. Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary. Serve immediately with the quartered gem lettuce." tag="recipes salad herbs lebanon food" hash="4eade10b640c05ddb28ca80ff44d1818" meta="d65d340c3d3bb48ad3453b909160c851"    />

The original members were guitarists Peter Haycock and Derek Holt, keyboardist Arthur Wood, bassist Richard Jones, drummer George Newsome, and vocalist and harmonica player Colin Cooper. In 1970, the group shortened its name to the Climax Blues Band due to pressure from the American band Chicago Transit Authority, later known simply as Chicago. The band has released at least seventeen albums and had a Top 10 hit with &quot;Couldn't Get It Right&quot;, which reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977. Led by Cooper, the former frontman of the R&amp;B group the Hipster Image, the Climax Chicago Blues Band was one of the leading lights of the late 1960s UK blues boom. Prior to the release of 1969's &quot;Plays On&quot;, Jones left the group, prompting Holt to move to bass. In 1970 they moved to the Harvest Records label, at the same time shifting towards a more rock-oriented sound on &quot;A Lot Of Bottle&quot;. Around the release of 1971's &quot;Tightly Knit&quot;, Newsome was replaced by John Cuffley. Upon Wood's exit in the wake of 1972's &quot;Rich Man&quot;, they continued on as a quartet, also dropping the &quot;Chicago&quot; portion of their name at that time. In 1974 the Climax Blues Band issued &quot;FM Live&quot;, a document of a New York radio concert. 1975's &quot;Stamp&quot; was their commercial breakthrough, and 1976's &quot;Gold Plated&quot; fared even better, spurred on by the success of the hit single &quot;Couldn't Get It Right&quot;. By the mid-1970s they were drawing crowds of up to 20,000 at U.S. concerts. However, the rise of punk rock effectively stopped the group in their tracks. Cooper died of cancer at age 69 in July 2008. However, the band continues to tour to the present day. This channel is dedicated to the classic rock hits that have become part of the history of our culture.

&gt; 1. Score sides of fish; place in a shallow dish. Whisk together half the shallots, lime juice, scallion, mustard, thyme, chile, salt, and pepper in a bowl and pour over fish; marinate 30 minutes.
&gt; 2. Heat oil in a 12″ skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomato paste and cook until it begins to caramelize, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup water and bring to a boil; cook, stirring, until almost evaporated, about 8–10 minutes. Remove fish from marinade and set aside; add marinade and sugar to skillet and cook, stirring, until shallots are soft, 4–5 minutes. Add fish and 3/4 cup water and cover skillet; cook, turning once, until fish is cooked through, 8–12 minutes. Transfer fish to a large serving platter. Season cooking liquid with salt and pepper and pour through a fine strainer over fish.

<post href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1619152/how-to-create-rest-urls-without-verbs/1619677#1619677" time="2013-06-02T13:22:09Z" description="How to create REST URLs without verbs?" extended="General principles for good URI design:

Don't use query parameters to alter state
Don't use mixed-case paths if you can help it; lowercase is best
Don't use implementation-specific extensions in your URIs (.php, .py, .pl, etc.)
Don't fall into RPC with your URIs
Do limit your URI space as much as possible
Do keep path segments short
Do prefer either /resource or /resource/; create 301 redirects from the one you don't use
Do use query parameters for sub-selection of a resource; i.e. pagination, search queries
Do move stuff out of the URI that should be in an HTTP header or a body
(Note: I did not say &quot;RESTful URI design&quot;; URIs are essentially opaque in REST.)

General principles for HTTP method choice:

Don't ever use GET to alter state; this is a great way to have the Googlebot ruin your day
Don't use PUT unless you are updating an entire resource
Don't use PUT unless you can also legitimately do a GET on the same URI
Don't use POST to retrieve information that is long-lived or that might be reasonable to cache
Don't perform an operation that is not idempotent with PUT
Do use GET for as much as possible
Do use POST in preference to PUT when in doubt
Do use POST whenever you have to do something that feels RPC-like
Do use PUT for classes of resources that are larger or hierarchical
Do use DELETE in preference to POST to remove resources
Do use GET for things like calculations, unless your input is large, in which case use POST
General principles of web service design with HTTP:

Don't put metadata in the body of a response that should be in a header
Don't put metadata in a separate resource unless including it would create significant overhead
Do use the appropriate status code
201 Created after creating a resource; resource must exist at the time the response is sent
202 Accepted after performing an operation successfully or creating a resource asynchronously
400 Bad Request when someone does an operation on data that's clearly bogus; for your application this could be a validation error; generally reserve 500 for uncaught exceptions
401 Unauthorized when someone accesses your API either without supplying a necessary Authorization header or when the credentials within the Authorization are invalid; don't use this response code if you aren't expecting credentials via an Authorization header.
403 Forbidden when someone accesses your API in a way that might be malicious or if they aren't authorized
405 Method Not Allowed when someone uses POST when they should have used PUT, etc
413 Request Entity Too Large when someone attempts to send you an unacceptably large file
418 I'm a teapot when attempting to brew coffee with a teapot
Do use caching headers whenever you can
ETag headers are good when you can easily reduce a resource to a hash value
Last-Modified should indicate to you that keeping around a timestamp of when resources are updated is a good idea
Cache-Control and Expires should be given sensible values
Do everything you can to honor caching headers in a request (If-None-Modified, If-Modified-Since)
Do use redirects when they make sense, but these should be rare for a web service
With regard to your specific question, POST should be used for #4 and #5. These operations fall under the &quot;RPC-like&quot; guideline above. For #5, remember that POST does not necessarily have to use Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

Mending clothes was once routine for every stratum of society. British aristocrats were unabashed at their elbow patches — in truth more prevention than cure, since they protected shooting jackets from wear caused by the shotgun butt. Everything got mended, and mending was a trade.

What sort of trade? Highly skilled, perhaps, but manual, consigning it to a low status in a culture that has always been shaped by the ancient Greek preference for thinking over doing (this is one way in which the West differs from the East). Over the course of the 19th century, the ‘pure’ theorist gained ascendancy over the ‘applied’ scientist (or worse still, the engineer); likewise, the professional engineer could at least pull rank on the maintenance man: he was a creator and innovator, not a chap with oily rag and tools. ‘Although central to our relationship with things,’ writes the historian of technology David Edgerton, ‘maintenance and repair are matters we would rather not think about.’ Indeed, they are increasingly matters we’d rather not even do.

Edgerton explains that, until the mid-20th century, repair was a permanent state of affairs, especially for expensive items such as vehicles, which ‘lived in constant interaction with a workshop’. It wasn’t so much that things stopped working and then got repaired, but that repair was the means by which they worked at all. Repair might even spawn primary manufacturing industries: many early Japanese bicycles were assembled from the spare parts manufactured to fix foreign (mostly British) models." tag="repair diy culture" hash="668dd6f1af1e729cd81190b42bd24681" meta="59e0333da7632ec9c42921922e0f009d"    />

She was attractive, mid-twenties, in great shape, and she was pulling out what, on closer inspection, turned out to be a baby stroller. I looked for a baby, and there it was, sitting on the curb in a carrier. This was all taking place in front of a nail salon, and a woman was sitting in the front window while her nails dried. This woman appeared to be in her mid-to-late-thirties and was well put together, but wearing a denim jacket in a failing attempt to somehow give the illusion of youth. She was staring at the baby and the look in her eyes was one of anguish and desperation. You could almost HEAR her thinking, “This is never going to happen for me. What choices did I make in my life that brought me to this place where it’s never going to happen for me?”
&gt; 
&gt; It smacked me like a wave, and it was one of those New York feelings that you only let yourself feel every three or four years where you’re just overwhelmed by how everything is too close, there’s too much anguish, it’s all too much in your face. The ragged homeless schizophrenic who mutters “I should call my mom, let her know I’m still alive.” The old man sitting alone in the diner ordering one more cup of coffee so that at least he has another few minutes before he has to return to the empty room where he’s the only one who knows or cares that he exists. The exhausted nurse smoking outside the hospital whose voice cracks on the cellphone as she tells her child that there’s something you can warm up in the oven, be sure to do your homework, I have to work a double shift tonight, I won’t be able to walk with you to school in the morning, before she hangs up the phone and lets the tears just roll. It’s all of it, all around you, and it never stops.
&gt; 
&gt; Then the next wave smacked me: The aging fat man, unshaven, shirttail hanging out, hunched demeanor, stopped short on the sidewalk staring at a woman in a nail salon. What’s his story? What sadness is he carrying around with him? Why the fuck won’t he keep walking?
&gt; 
&gt; So I kept walking. I mean, what else are you gonna do?" tag="writing nyc" hash="a7d268885fbfd4563b979c91d4005285" meta="23372b1539695167a8996c3383a81a77"    />

We believe that the future of technology will be largely determined by end-users who will design, build, and hack their own devices, and our goal is to inspire, shape, support, and study these communities. To this end, we explore the intersection of computation, physical materials, manufacturing processes, traditional crafts, and design.

Butt now lives in Florida and runs the Official Website of the Original Long Island Iced Tea. &quot;It's amazing to me how many hits I get,&quot; he said. &quot;I probably get forty hits a day.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; A good Long Island Iced Tea, Butt said, is stealthy: &quot;When it's made right, you can't tell how strong it is.&quot; He invented the drink like a child at a soda fountain, taking all the clear liquors at his bar station and mixing them together. When a colleague said it tasted a bit like tea, Butt added a splash of Coke and said, &quot;Now it looks like tea, too.&quot; In no time, the Oak Beach Inn was mixing Long Island Iced Teas in the basement and serving them on tap. 41 years later, he got his credit due, when PBS featured him on its &quot;Inventor&quot; series.

&gt; 
&gt; 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon salt
&gt; 1 chicken with skin, about 2 1/2 pounds, cut up into 8 pieces (see note)
&gt; 1 teaspoon black pepper
&gt; 1 cup all-purpose flour
&gt; 2 cups vegetable oil, like grapeseed, peanut or canola (do not use olive oil)
&gt; 1/4 cup bacon drippings (or use more oil)
&gt; PREPARATION
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Combine 1 tablespoon salt with 3 quarts water in a large bowl or container. Add chicken, cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Drain, rinse with cold water and pat dry.
&gt; 2. Stir together remaining 1 teaspoon salt and the black pepper. Sprinkle half the mixture evenly over chicken.
&gt; 3. In a large sealable plastic bag, combine remaining pepper mixture and flour. Add 2 pieces chicken to bag and shake well to coat. Remove chicken pieces, shaking off extra flour, and set aside. Repeat with remaining chicken.
&gt; 4. Take a large (10- or 12-inch) cast-iron skillet or chicken fryer, for which you have a lid, and fit with a candy or deep-frying thermometer. Add oil and bacon drippings and heat to 360 degrees over medium heat; the oil will ripple and possibly give off a few wisps of smoke.
&gt; 5. Using tongs, immediately add chicken pieces, skin side down (work in batches if necessary to avoid crowding pan). The oil will drop to about 325 degrees, where it should stay; adjust heat so that oil is bubbling gently around the pieces. Cover and cook 6 minutes; uncover and cook 9 minutes. Turn chicken pieces; cover and cook 6 minutes. Uncover and cook another 5 to 9 minutes, depending on size of pieces. If necessary for even browning, turn pieces over a few times toward the end.
&gt; 6. Drain on paper towels or paper bags. Let cool at least 20 minutes before serving.
&gt;
&gt; YIELD 4 servings
&gt; NOTEIf chicken is larger than 2 1/2 pounds, use a large heavy knife to cut each breast half in half again, making 10 pieces in total." tag="chicken fried food recipes cooking nytimes southern" hash="728fb5a41a9b80a91fffd2598bc8e06b" meta="22b0a12ea4a7d659b4de3f31644afec4"    />

<post href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Muerte" time="2013-05-14T14:23:39Z" description="Santa Muerte" extended="&gt; Santa Muerte, Spanish for Saint Death, is a sacred figure and feminine skeletal folk saint venerated primarily in Mexico and the United States. As a figure made holy by popular belief, the saint of death developed through syncretism between Mesoamerican indigenous and Spanish Catholic beliefs and practices. Santa Muerte, the name in Spanish, literally translates to &quot;Saint Death&quot; or &quot;Holy Death&quot;. Since the pre-Columbian era Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death, which can be seen in the widespread commemoration of the syncretic Day of the Dead. Elements of that celebration include the use of skeletons to remind people of their mortality. The worship is condemned by the Catholic Church in Mexico as invalid, but it is firmly entrenched among Mexico’s lower working classes and various elements of society deemed as &quot;outcasts&quot;.
&gt; Santa Muerte generally appears as a female skeletal figure, clad in a long robe and holding one or more objects, usually a scythe and a globe. Her robe can be of any color, as more specific images of the figure vary widely from devotee to devotee and according to the rite being performed or the petition being made. As the worship of Santa Muerte was clandestine until the 20th century, most prayers and other rites have been traditionally performed privately in the home. However, for the past ten years or so, worship has become more public, especially in Mexico City after Enriqueta Romero initiated her famous Mexico City shrine in 2001. The number of believers in Santa Muerte has grown over the past ten to twenty years, to several million followers in Mexico, the United States, and parts of Central America. Santa Muerte has similar male counterparts in the Americas, such as the skeletal folk saints San La Muerte of Argentina and Rey (King) Pascual of Guatemala." tag="death mexico mythology religion wikipedia" hash="5d26fafa1c0fdfd2fb4a8aaa82e38d07" meta="7db3bdf1ebfad196c5fe4133f4ca3307"    />

He used his remote to lift and close the garage door in the hopes of flagging someone down, but to no avail.
&gt; 
&gt; So he left the garage door open and stared out the windshield from his front-row seat to a world that was oblivious to him.
&gt; 
&gt; Cars passed, then days. A postal worker passed by without hearing his cries. The sun turned the garage into a sauna. He ate his groceries — the ice cream cones, Fig Newtons and pound cake — but there was no water.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Jeez, it's been three days,&quot; he remembers thinking. &quot;I hope I don't die in this car.&quot;

&gt; This cartographic Tapestry is woven from a geologic map and a shaded relief image. This digital combination reveals the geologic history of North America through the interrelation of rock type, topography and time. Regional surface processes as well as continent-scale tectonic events are exposed in the three dimensions of space and the fourth dimension, geologic time. The large map shows the varying age of bedrock underlying North America, while four smaller maps show the distribution of four principal types of rock: sedimentary, volcanic, plutonic and metamorphic." tag="usgs pdf maps usa geology" hash="00800daff68b5cabd882d5c02fe47b97" meta="cf6d334bb430b16014fbe418931fcd4c"    />

Fuller had been collecting clippings and artifacts since he was a child. But in 1917, he began a formal chronological file which he would later call the Dymaxion Chronofile. The Chronofile was a vast scrapbook that included copies of all his incoming and outgoing correspondence, newspaper clippings, notes and sketches, and even dry cleaning bills. Initially, the Chronofile was bound into handsome leather-backed volumes. In later years, to save space and expenses, the Chronofile was simply stored in boxes.

Later, German climatologist Rudolf Geiger collaborated with Köppen on changes to the classification system, which is thus sometimes referred to as the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system. The system is based on the concept that native vegetation is the best expression of climate. Thus, climate zone boundaries have been selected with vegetation distribution in mind.

It uses the Transfer-Encoding HTTP header in place of the Content-Length header, which the protocol would otherwise require. Because the Content-Length header is not used, the sender does not need to know the length of the content before it starts transmitting a response to the receiver. Senders can begin transmitting dynamically-generated content before knowing the total size of that content.
&gt; The size of each chunk is sent right before the chunk itself so that the receiver can tell when it has finished receiving data for that chunk. The data transfer is terminated by a final chunk of length zero." tag="http chunked data internet" hash="046c7ec79f6404f188080304638f346e" meta="83134e524f32e5debecb0f0beccc898a"    />

Its center consists of a siliceous breccia covering an area that is at least 3 km in diameter.

&gt; Total Time: 20 minutes Serves: 6-8
&gt; 
&gt; Ingredients
&gt; For the steak:
&gt; 
&gt; 2 pounds skirt steak, membrane trimmed and discarded
&gt; 3 tablespoons olive oil
&gt; 1 teaspoon coarse salt
&gt; 
&gt; For the slaw:
&gt; 
&gt; 1 small green cabbage (about 1½ pounds)
&gt; 2 bunches scallions, white and light- green parts only, thinly sliced
&gt; ½ pound thick-cut bacon, diced
&gt; 2 large shallots, finely diced
&gt; ¼ cup olive oil
&gt; ¼ cup Sherry vinegar
&gt; 2 tablespoons sugar
&gt; 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
&gt; ½ teaspoon salt
&gt; 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
&gt; 3 tablespoons heavy cream
&gt; 
&gt; What To Do
&gt; 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Set a grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush steak with oil and sprinkle salt evenly on both sides of meat. Place steak on grill pan and cook until just seared on both sides, about a minute per side. You will know it's ready to turn when the meat no longer sticks to the pan.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Transfer steak to a baking rack set on a baking sheet. Place in oven and cook until steak reaches desired doneness, 3-4 minutes for medium-rare.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.Transfer steak to a cutting board and let it rest for at least 10 minutes before serving.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Meanwhile, finely chop or coarsely grate cabbage, discarding core. Place cabbage in a large bowl with scallions and stir to combine.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Place bacon in a heavy skillet over medium heat and cook until crisp, 3-4 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of bacon fat from pan and add shallots. Cook until soft, 2-3 minutes. Whisk in oil, vinegar and sugar, then turn off heat. Whisk in white pepper, salt, mustard and cream.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. Pour warm dressing over cabbage and scallions and stir to combine. Stir in reserved bacon.
&gt; 
&gt; 8. Slice steak against the grain and serve with warm slaw." tag="recipes steak slaw bacon cooking food" hash="9049e2a5e214e1288c10b737ec7ad8e3" meta="c211e021dafaa119be4a6f19fd4a8049"    />

&gt; Serves 2
&gt; When I went to the market yesterday I lingered over the trout for a good five minutes before the man behind the counter got impatient with me and demanded I make up my mind. It didn’t seem right to cook trout for this book, even despite it being mentioned so many times throughout. I ended up buying branzino instead, but trout would certainly work for this recipe, as would just about any fish.
&gt; 
&gt; 1 1 ½ pound whole trout, branzino, or any fish you prefer, gutted and scaled
&gt; ¼ pound unsalted butter (1 stick), softened
&gt; 4 sprigs each thyme, parsley, dill, rosemary
&gt; 3 cloves garlic
&gt; 2 lemons
&gt; 1 cup dry white wine
&gt; Salt and pepper to taste
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Directions:
&gt; 
&gt; This herb butter freezes well and will stay good for at least a month (refrigerated about a week and a half). It’s a great thing to have on hand to make anything fancier (bread, pasta, roasted vegetables) and also a good way to put wilting herbs to use rather than throw them away.
&gt; 
&gt; Place your butter in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Finely chop your picked herbs and garlic and add them to the butter. Add 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper and beat until well-mixed. Scoop the butter onto a sheet of plastic wrap and roll it tightly into a tube-shape. Refrigerate until set, about 40 minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; Pre-heat your oven to 450 degrees F. Rinse your fish and pat it dry. Salt the inside and outside of the fish well and place it in a shallow baking dish (I had to cut the tail off of mine so that it would fit). Cut half of your herb butter into disks and place the rest in the fridge (you’ll only be using half). Stuff butter disks inside of the fish and top with lemon slices. Do the same on the outside of the fish. Salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Add about 1 cup of dry white wine to the baking dish and cover with tinfoil. Place in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove tinfoil and roast 7-10 more minutes. The meat should release from the bones and you should be able to “unzip” the fish and enjoy the meat easily." tag="recipes fish herbs books butter food" hash="81ad29f46f12a0c10c159ede12b18190" meta="9cf63bcaf456e8d31d854626baa7b13d"    />

The Mary Celeste was in seaworthy condition and still under sail heading toward the Strait of Gibraltar. She had been at sea for a month and had over six months' worth of food and water on board.

<post href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2013/03/18/http-archive-jquery/" time="2013-03-19T02:47:01Z" description="HTTP Archive: jQuery | High Performance Web Sites" extended="This blog post contains many statistics that are useful in deciding whether to load jQuery from Google Hosted Libraries. The pros of requesting jQuery core from Google Hosted Libraries are:

potential benefit of cross-site caching
ease of switching if you’re already loading jQuery core as a standalone request
no hosting, storage, bandwidth, nor maintenance costs
benefit of Google’s CDN performance
1-year cache time
The cons to loading jQuery from Google Hosted Libraries include:

an extra DNS lookup
you might use a different CDN that’s faster
can’t combine jQuery with your other scripts
There are two other more complex but potentially significant issues to think about if you’re considering bundling jQuery with your other scripts. (Thanks to Ilya Grigorik for mentioning these.)

First, combining multiple scripts together increases the likelihood of the resource needing to be updated. This is especially true with regard to bundling with jQuery since jQuery is likely to change less than your site-specific JavaScript.

Second, unlike an HTML document, a script is not parsed incrementally. That’s why some folks, like Gmail, load their JavaScript in an iframe segmented into multiple inline script blocks thus allowing the JavaScript engine to parse and execute the initial blocks while the file is still being downloaded. Combining scripts into a single, large script might reach the point where delayed parsing would be offset by downloading two or more scripts. As far as I know this has not been investigated enough to determine how “large” the script must be to reach the point of negative returns.

If you’re loading core jQuery as a standalone request from your own server (which 38% of sites are doing), you’ll probably get an easy performance boost by switching to Google Hosted Libraries. If you’re considering creating a combined script that includes jQuery, the issues raised here may mean that’s not the optimal solution.

SteveW and I both agree: To make the best decision, website owners need to test the alternatives.

Efforts led by a range of organizations, including the Library of Congress, HathiTrust, and the Internet Archive, have successfully built resources that provide books, images, historical records, and audiovisual materials to anyone with Internet access. Many universities, public libraries, and other public-spirited organizations have digitized materials that could be brought together under the frame of the DPLA, but these digital collections often exist in silos. Compounding this problem are disparate technical standards, disorganized and incomplete metadata, and a host of legal issues. No project has yet succeeded in bringing these different viewpoints, experiences, and collections together with leading technical experts and the best of private industry to find solutions to these complex challenges. Users have neither coherent access to these materials nor tools to use them in new and exciting ways, and institutions have no clear blueprint for creating a shared infrastructure to serve the public good. The time is right to launch an ambitious project to realize the great promise of the Internet for the advancement of sharing information and of using technology to enable new knowledge and discoveries in the United States." tag="library internet history books research archives" hash="afcc08a502a49ba3ee89d9785e537d28" meta="996a3d34b5e52e852ad227e7a7faa1cd"    />

Ozero Baykal; IPA: [ˈozʲɪrə bɐjˈkal]; Buryat: Байгал нуур, Mongolian: Байгал нуур, Baygal nuur, meaning &quot;nature lake&quot;;) is a rift lake in the south of the Russian region of Siberia, between the Irkutsk Oblast to the northwest and the Buryat Republic to the southeast.
Lake Baikal is the most voluminous freshwater lake in the world, containing roughly 20% of the world's unfrozen surface fresh water, and at 1,642 m (5,387 ft), the deepest. It is also among the clearest of all lakes, and thought to be the world's oldest lake at 25 million years.
Similar to Lake Tanganyika, Lake Baikal was formed as an ancient rift valley, having the typical long crescent shape with a surface area of 31,722 km2 (12,248 sq mi). Baikal is home to more than 1,700 species of plants and animals, two thirds of which can be found nowhere else in the world and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. It is also home to Buryat tribes who reside on the eastern side of Lake Baikal, rearing goats, camels, cattle and sheep, where the regional average temperatures vary from a minimum of −19 °C (−2 °F) in winter to maximum of 14 °C (57 °F) in summer.

INGREDIENTS
4 8-oz. flat iron steaks
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
8 tbsp. unsalted butter, softened
3 tbsp. roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley
3 tbsp. roughly chopped chives
1 shallot, finely chopped
4 tbsp. canola oil

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Rub steaks generously with salt and pepper and set aside to let rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. Combine the butter, parsley, chives, and shallots with a fork in a medium bowl. Season lightly with salt and pepper; cover with plastic wrap and set aside.

2. Heat 2 tbsp. oil in a 12&quot; cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 steaks and cook, flipping once, until seared and medium rare, about 8 minutes. Transfer steaks to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining oil and steaks. To serve, smear each steak with 2 tbsp. of the herb butter.

Pairing note The peppery 2005 syrah from Napa Valley's Kuleto Estate ($45) is big and earthy, with plenty of acidity and deep blackberry flavors that stand up to this steak." tag="steak cooking recipes food butter herbs" hash="9201798c6a76131352bec550ff049fec" meta="c618a055a8de12e7b9e5219302bf78d6"    />

<post href="http://www.publicationstudio.biz/" time="2013-02-19T00:13:34Z" description="Publication Studio" extended="We print and bind books on demand, creating original work with artists and writers we admire. We use any means possible to help writers and artists reach a public: physical books; a digital commons (where anyone can read and annotate our books for free); eBooks; and unique social events with our writers and artists in many cities. We attend to the social life of the book. Publication Studio is a laboratory for publication in its fullest sense—not just the production of books, but the production of a public. This public, which is more than a market, is created through physical production, digital circulation, and social gathering. Together these construct a space of conversation, a public space, which beckons a public into being.

Currently there are eight Publication Studios, in Portland (run by Patricia No and Antonia Pinter), the San Francisco Bay Area, CA (run by Ian Dolton-Thornton, with sage advice from Colter Jacobsen), Vancouver, BC, Canada (run by Keith Higgins and Kathy Slade), Toronto, Ontario, Canada (run by Derek McCormack, Alana Wilcox, and Michael Maranda), Boston (run by Sam Gould), Portland, Maine (run by Daniel Fuller and the Institute for Contemporary Art), Philadelphia (run by Robert Blackson and the Tyler School of Art), Los Angeles (run by Sergio Pastor, Matthew Schum, and Lizzie Fitch), and Malmö, Sweden, run by Ola Stahl. To contact one of the Publication Studios, click on its name on the home-page of this site.

Our books can be bought online (click “store” in the menu to your left) or at any Publication Studio. In addition we sell through over 60 bookshops worldwide, including St. Marks Books (New York), READ Books at Emily Carr University (Vancouver, BC, Canada), Hennessey and Ingalls (Los Angeles, CA), Third Place Books (Seattle, WA), Utrecht (Tokyo, Japan), ICA bookshop (London, UK), A Estante (Lisbon, Portugal), ProQM (Berlin, Germany), Librairie Yvon Lambert (Paris, France), Buchhandlung Walther König (Cologne, Germany), Monograph Bookwerks (Portland, OR), Dashwood Books (New York, NY), the Whitney Museum Bookstore (New York, NY), the New Museum Bookstore (New York, NY), Marfa Book Co (Marfa, TX) and many others.

Publication Studio has conducted past residency projects at the Henry Art Gallery (Seattle, WA), Emily Carr University (Vancouver, BC), Yale University (New Haven, CT) and Ecole d’Enseignement Superieur d’Art de Bordeaux (Bordeaux, FR) and collaborated with innumerable artists and cultural institutions on new publications and projects.

Publication Studio also offers fee-based services, including: perfect binding, design and consultation. Please email ps@publicationstudio.biz for more information regarding our services.

<post href="http://www.ubu.com/ethno/" time="2013-02-15T00:44:51Z" description="U B U W E B :: E T H N O P O E T I C S" extended="The breakthroughs of the last 100 years in poetry and elsewhere have been marked by new approaches to language and performance. Largely this has been the work of several generations of experimental writers and performers, many of them now archived and available thru Ubuweb and related web sites. It fell to some of us, starting with forerunners like Tristan Tzara and Antonin Artaud, to track related but traditional approaches over a wide range of once impenetrable cultures throughout the world. In my own work I was able to bring some of these lines together in gatherings of the 1960s and 1970s like Technicians of the Sacred and Shaking the Pumpkin, as well as in the magazine Alcheringa that I co-edited for several years with Dennis Tedlock. The name that we gave this enterprise, as it applied to the world’s deep cultures – those surviving in situ as well as those that had vanished except for transcriptions in books or recordings from earlier decades – was ethnopoetics.

In the present Ubuweb collection of ethnopoetic openings, it’s our intention to build a sampler of what we take to be the second great breakthrough of the modernist poetry project. The search here is for a range of poetries outside the domain of customarily accepted literature. In particular we’re interested, in the spirit of other segments of Ubuweb, in soundings and visionings that are the traditional and often culturally acceptable counterparts to what in our own surroundings have been seen and heard as radical, even disturbing departures from conventional practice. In exploring these we will also be mindful of occasions on which the avant-garde experimental line has merged with or deliberately drawn from other culturally specific traditions.

We proceed in the spirit of Gertrude Stein, often quoted by me: The exciting thing about all this is that as it is new it is old and as it is old it is new, but now we have come to be in our way which is an entirely different way.

The majority of my interactions with online friends is perpetuating some injoke so arcane that nobody remembers how it started or what it actually means.

This architectural style was used in order to protect residents from Bedouin attacks. While Shibam has been in existence for an estimated 1,700 years, most of the city's houses originate from the 16th century. Many, though, have been rebuilt numerous times in the last few centuries.

Shibam is often called &quot;the oldest skyscraper city in the world&quot; or &quot;the Manhattan of the desert&quot;, and is one of the oldest and best examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction. The city has some of the tallest mud buildings in the world, with some of them over 30 meters (100 feet) high, thus being early high-rise apartment buildings. In order to protect the buildings from rain and erosion, the walls must be routinely maintained by applying fresh layers of mud.

One of my favourite quotes ever is from Jack Schulze, a principal at the London design studio BERG (and great, tall and lovely, swear-y man). He said: No one cares what you do unless you think about it and no one cares what you think unless you do it.

http://straup.github.com/parallel-flickr/

Parallel Flickr is an exercise to create a living breathing archive of my Flickr photos. Not a replacement but something other than the usual cold storage backup systems we've all grown used to. It was also an exercise to work through the idea of what it means for an individual to take a more active responsibility in archiving the digital bits that are left all over the internet.

Parallel Flickr is meant to run alongside the site itself and be a ready alternative if ever the worst happened and Flickr shut down. The really important piece of this setup is that it mirrors are the URL structures of Flickr itself. The domain name might change but otherwise all the URLs should just keep working.

One day I was talking with my friend Mike about all of this. He asked me: Does it make more sense for me to run a single instance of parallel-flickr for my five friends or should they all run their own copy?

The beauty of Parallel Flickr is that you can do either, or both. If you and I merge our copies of Parallel Flickr and we encounter collisions across numeric identifiers it just means that we each have a copy of the same photo.

This is the neighbourhood I moved to, in Brooklyn. It's called Gowanus Heights and it's a neighbourhood that didn't exist before we got there. About a month after we arrived I spent close to 20 minutes, one afternoon, trying to figure out what neighbourhood the various location-based web services thought my street corner was part of. I still don't know.

There aren't that many neighbourhoods to choose from so eventually I just created one. This is just an anecdote so don't worry too much about how the social geographies of New York City fit together but if real estate agents can do this then why can't I? This is how culture is made, right?

...

What if we could issue unique identifiers for every instance of a design object. A coffee maker for instance or, if we want to side-step the privacy question altogether, fire hydrants. Each fire hydrant would be able to exist as an atomic, addressable entity but still be able to point back to their heritage, so to speak, both as physical (geographic) and cultural objects.

...

The whole point of putting our collections online is so that they will be there in 50 years. In 100 years. They will still call back when addressed because that's, I thought, the business we were all in keeping this stuff.

...

Because this is what 2012 looks like for museums.

It is most definitely not about Twitter but about the fact that some random person out there on the Internet is building a record of understanding about Roombas that may well rival anything we will ever do ourselves.

Beyond that, we are being forced to accept the fact that our collections are becoming &quot;alive&quot;. Or at least they are assuming the plausible illusion of being alive.

...

One of the tiny victories in the alpha version of the new Cooper-Hewitt collections website is calling out that although there might have been 400 objects in an exhibition we will only show six of them. But that's only going to buy a very limited amount of grace time. How long before someone out there, who has nothing to do with museums, starts building websites that pull in data from all the participating museum websites to create an exhibitions site that reflects, well, reality?

...

If we're going to keep telling people that we have all this nice stuff and that its in their interest that we keep it we need to be able to at least prove that it exists.

The “responsive conditions” were typical mobile patterns. We made the site fluid. We collapsed the primary navigation menu, allowing visitors to expand it by tapping a Menu link. We increased the size of the font, the tap areas and detail photos. We reduced the number of columns. We spent a lot of time just “fixing Magento forms.” Everything in a way that lets the O’Neill team continue to manage 100% of the content on the site.

No matter when that happens, it will happen, and when it does, you’re introduced to the free software hidden costs. Then you’ll have to defocus from your business so you can learn how to go after developers, learn how to explain what you need in a way they’ll understand, learn how to work with developers, and then, after all that, pay them. All this learning takes a lot of time and resources you could be using to build up your business.

The same goes for cheap software. Companies that undervalue their product are not only bound to failure, but even worse, many already know it. That’s the reason why you see a lot of them selling cheap lifetime licenses of their software. It’s the best way of saying “Hey, I know you won’t be here for too long, so we’ll just make a quick buck and soon when our solution doesn’t fit you anymore you can just throw it away, which doesn’t matter because we’ll already have our profit.”

Lifetime licenses are outdated strategies used by companies with short customer lifecycle, and it goes without saying that costumer lifecycle is the best metric for knowing how good, or how bad, a product or service really is.

I think what The Magazine's done, what Marco's done inside The Magazine, what I've tried to outline in Subcompact Publishing is just &quot;How do we create as minimal as possible a space, so that you can add interactive content on top of that if you want to.&quot; I think that there's something nice about having a packet of information delivered, and part of in Subcompact Publishing why I talk about chunking together groups of articles is because I'm kinda of the mindset that users shouldn't be forced to constantly pull to refresh, constantly be sucking on the teat of information, for an endless stream of new content. It should come to them when a certain amount of great content is read. That’s the idea.

...

I think people aren't paying for the content explicitly — what they're paying for is that package, what they're paying for is the convenience. They're paying for the fulfillment of a certain job that that app brings, which is this consolidated sort of thought list, in the sense that I as a user don't have to think at all about “how do I get to content?” “where do I read it?” “do I have to go and grab new content?” No, it's just going to be there.

At the very end of a 1 1/2 mile wood road on 11+ forested acres bordering the Potic Creek. This is a charming 'Camping Cabin' in the woods on more than 11 acres of woodlands overlooking the Potic Creek, a stream that flows from a reservoir serving the town of Catskill. The Cabin is insulated and has an airtight woodstove. There is a Murphy bed with a queen size mattress. It does not have running water or electric - that's what 'camping cabin' refers to. The forest has lots of wildlife, deer, bear, wild turkeys, foxes, racoons, great horned owls, etc. For cooking there is a Coleman camp stove, and outside, a fire pit with a grill. It is an idyllic getaway for those who appreciate nature. It is about 25 miles north from the Village of Woodstock, about 2 hour drive from the GWB. Before you consider staying at the cabin, please read carefully our description below.

The editors of the award-winning monthly magazine the Believer, published in San Francisco by McSweeney’s, produce ten annual episodes of the podcast, which includes reported stories, interviews, comic radio drama, reviews, and more. The scope of the podcast reflects that of the print edition: its contributors take a thoughtful approach to pop culture, along with an irreverent attitude toward the highbrow. From philosophy to daytime TV, from poetry to martial arts, the show scrutinizes and interrogates the world with an affectionate and rigorous intelligence. Pieces from the podcast grow out of stories in the magazine, and vice versa. Weaving together the voices of its contributors, which include the brightest talents in literature and the arts, the Organist is an elegant, impressionistic, funny, and sharp cultural magazine that itself becomes an object of inquiry, discussion, and wonder.

National parks must be established by an act of the United States Congress. The first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service &quot;to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.&quot; National parks usually have a variety of natural resources over large areas. Many of them had been previously protected as National Monuments by the President under the Antiquities Act before being upgraded by Congress. Seven national parks are paired with a National Preserve, six of which are in Alaska. While administered together, they are considered as separate units and their areas are not included in the figures below. The newest national park is Pinnacles National Park, upgraded in 2013.

Begun in AD 122, during the rule of emperor Hadrian, it was the first of two fortifications built across Great Britain, the second being the Antonine Wall, lesser known of the two because its physical remains are less evident today.

The wall was the most heavily fortified border in the Empire. In addition to its role as a military fortification, it is thought that many of the gates through the wall would have served as customs posts to allow trade and levy taxation.

A significant portion of the wall still exists, having been rescued in the 19th century by John Clayton, who, alarmed at the destruction by quarrying, bought a number of sections. For much of its length, the wall can be followed on foot by Hadrian's Wall Path or by cycle on National Cycle Route 72. It is the most popular tourist attraction in Northern England. It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. English Heritage, a government organisation in charge of managing the historic environment of England, describes it as &quot;the most important monument built by the Romans in Britain&quot;." tag="england ancient history roman wall structures" hash="8cd12c1ab4079ab2e709a850509343eb" meta="8b2af9a1ee147501f4da4b06ee99eaaa"    />

There are a lot more cabs than cops so cabbies will find it first -- and they're more frequently going in places cops typically don't go, like apartment and motel complex parking lots, back alleys etc. Lastly, once the car is found, a swarm of cabs will descend and surround it because cabbies, like anyone else, love excitement and want to catch bad guys.

In my experience, creative and intellectual work flows from physical engagement with the landscape. There are literal manifestations of this, such as the discovery of forgotten places and the collection of forgotten literature from the shelves of a rural shop. More intangibly, the processes of walking, hiking, or taking a road trip are useful activities for developing new ideas or thinking through puzzles.

...

This sounds like I’m emphasizing the differences between analog and digital modes of access, and I am, but with the intent of showing that they can be so different from one another that they complement and do not compete with each other. The physical library offers not just a single irreproducible experience—browsing—but thousands of irreproducible experiences of browsing-based discovery. Looked at in this way, my point is to reframe what’s too often a competition between digital access and analog browsing. I see them as very different, and most effective when they are combined and dovetailed.

...

I am intrigued when I’m asked how I feel about our inability to save everything, as if this should make me sad. Why are we so focused on completism? The idea that a complete archives of human activity and experience constitutes a good thing isn’t by any means a new idea, but it gained currency a few years back when technological advances convinced many of us that collecting and preserving everything was possible. Then, just as in feature bloat, possibility turned into desirability. The data firehose has convinced us that selection is impossible, and we assume that decisions as to what we save will be determined purely by our IT capabilities. That cultural and social criteria (not to mention power differentials) might actively determine what we preserve—well, that’s turned into an oldskool idea." tag="Reading.am library reading research archiving film books america" hash="f6bb09a5c24597896c1d255dff281438" meta="5289c5290ebd3b51c4b7f2eaccb46ac9"    />

<post href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shine_On_You_Crazy_Diamond" time="2013-01-31T16:05:51Z" description="Shine On You Crazy Diamond - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" extended="Parts I–V

As neither the original vinyl release (1975) nor the CD re-release actually delineates precisely the various divisions, the make-up of the parts below is based on a comparison of the recorded timings with the identifications in the published sheet music. Without benefit of the publication, it is easy to perceive Parts I and II as Part I, Part III as Part II, and so on, with the extensive postlude of Part V (at 11:15) as the beginning of the fifth section.

Part I (Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 0:00 – 3:54) begins with the fade-in of a dense G-minor synthesizer pad created with an EMS VCS 3, ARP Solina, a Hammond organ and the sounds of wet fingers rubbing the rims of wine glasses (recycled from an earlier project known as &quot;Household Objects&quot;). This is followed by plaintive Minimoog passages followed by a lengthy, bluesy guitar solo played by Gilmour on a Fender Stratocaster (neck pickup) using a heavily compressed sound and reverb. The harmony changes from G minor to D minor at 2:29, then to C minor, and back to G minor. This is repeated again, and the part ends with the synth pad fading into the background.

Part II (Waters, Gilmour, Wright; from 3:55 – 6:26) begins with a four-note theme (B♭, F, G, E) repeated throughout much of the entire section. This theme leads the harmony to C major (in comparison to the use of C minor in Parts I and II). Mason starts his drumming after the fourth playing of the four-note theme, which is the point where the riffs get into a fixed tempo, in 6/4 time. The chord leads back to G minor (as from Part I), followed by Eb major and D major back to a coda from G minor. This part includes another solo by Gilmour.

Part III (Gilmour, Wright, Waters; from 6:27 – 8:41) begins with a Minimoog solo by Wright. This part includes Gilmour's third guitar solo, which is bluesy in tone, and ends with a fade into Part IV. When performed on the Animals tour, Gilmour added distortion to the guitar for this solo (This bluesy guitar solo is often dropped in live performances whilst the rest of part III is still played—notably Delicate Sound of Thunder and Pulse.)

Part IV (Waters, Gilmour, Wright; from 8:42 – 11:14) Waters is the lead vocalist, with Gilmour, Wright and female backing vocalists on harmonies.

Part V (Waters, Gilmour, Wright; from 11:15 – 13:40) Part IV is followed by two guitars repeating an arpeggio riff for about a minute with the theme of Part II. A baritone saxophone overlays the sounds, played by Dick Parry. It ends as the saxophone changes from a baritone to a tenor saxophone. After, a time signature switch from 6/8 to 12/8 creates the appearance that the tempo speeds up, though the arpeggio guitar part in the background remains unchanged. The sax solo is accompanied by an ARP string synthesizer keyboard sound. A machine-like hum fades in and segues into &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;.

Parts VI–IX

Part VI (Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 0:00 – 4:55) begins with a howling wind from the preceding song &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. As the wind fades away, Gilmour comes in on the bass guitar. Waters adds another bass with a continuing riff pattern. Then Wright comes in playing an ARP String Ensemble Synthesizer and after a few measures, several rhythm guitar parts (Gilmour played the power chord rhythm part using his black Fender Stratocaster before switching to lap steel guitar for the solo in live performances from 1974-77. Snowy White did the rhythm guitar parts on this track on the band's 1977 &quot;In the Flesh&quot; tour) and drums come in, as well as a Minimoog synthesizer to play the opening solo. At the two minute mark, Wright's Minimoog and Gilmour's lap steel guitar play notes in unison before Gilmour does a lap steel guitar solo (the lap steel had open E minor tuning) with some counterpointing from Wright's synthesizers. It lasts for about three minutes (four when played on the band's &quot;In the Flesh&quot; tour) and Gilmour played each section an octave higher than the previous one. The highest note he hit on the lap steel/slide solo was a B-flat nearly three octaves above middle C, followed by a reprise of the guitar solo from Part IV (which was played by White live on Pink Floyd's 1977 tour so Gilmour could switch from the lap steel guitar back to his Fender Stratocaster). The song then switches time signatures to 6/4 (found in Parts II-V), giving the appearance of a slower tempo and reintroducing the vocals.

Part VII (Waters, Gilmour, Wright; from 4:56 – 6:04) contains the vocals, almost identical to Part IV (though half the length) before segueing into Part VIII.

Part VIII (Gilmour, Wright, Waters; from 6:05 – 8:59) brings in Waters to play a second electric guitar for a high-noted sound riff while Gilmour plays the arpeggio riff that bridges Parts VII and VIII. A solid progression of funk in 4/4 plays for about two minutes before very slowly fading out as a single sustained keyboard note fades in around the nine-minute mark. Throughout this section, Wright's keyboards dominate, with the use of a Minimoog synthesizer, and a Hohner Clavinet. However, when this section was played live on the band's 1977 &quot;In the Flesh&quot; tour, the sound was filled out by both Gilmour and White, who would trade guitar solos in a duet (or known as the battle between Gilmour's black with white pick-ups Strat and White's Goldtop Gibson Les Paul) which would extend this section upwards to between five and ten minutes.

Part IX (Wright, from 9:00 – 12:31) is played in 4/4 time. Gilmour described Part IX in an interview as &quot;a slow 4/4 funeral march... the parting musical eulogy to Syd&quot;. Again, Wright's keyboards dominate, with little guitar input from Gilmour. The drums play for half of this part, and the keyboards play for the final minute before fading out. On the fade-out, a short keyboard part of the melody of &quot;See Emily Play&quot; (at 12:12), one of Barrett's signature Pink Floyd songs, can be heard; live versions additionally featured snippets of &quot;Bike&quot;, &quot;The Gnome&quot;, &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;, and &quot;Arnold Layne&quot;. When played live on the 1977 tour, the piano plays the chords on its own before the synthesizer solo was slowly changed from itself (early part of European leg) into half synthesizer and harmony guitar solo by Gilmour (higher notes) and White (lower notes; on the end of the European leg and April and May, 1977 US performances) and then first a bluesy Gilmour solo followed by a harmony guitar solo by Gilmour (higher notes) and White (lower notes; on the June and July, 1977 US performances) finally before ending with the synthesizer solo as on record. Part IX, and the album, ends on G major, a Picardy third." tag="music pink.floyd wikipedia songs" hash="51f584c9b471e37943868051b33c7a62" meta="f82f950c02bb9c7981e335c185d1679e"    />

Certainly its size and the fact that millions upon millions of people have access to and actually use it make it unlike anything the world has ever seen before, and I don't want to downplay those accomplishments. But it's hard to discern what is genuinely new about Wikipedia and what falls in line with historical patterns if you only compare it to the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Instead, when you place Wikipedia in a longer timeframe, it seems that the historical anomaly was not today's online collaboration, but the 20th century's professionalized, bureaucratically produced tomes.

In fact, this seems to be true of so many of the Internet's &quot;innovations&quot;: Blogs look like 18th- and 19th-century publishers more than they do The New York Times or The Washington Post; small crafters selling their wares on Etsy look more like earlier markets than the 20th century's big chains. We have a tendency to reach for the most recent historical examples as our benchmarks, but when you take a longer view, you see that we haven't so much as broken with the past as repeated it.

Print-runs can be as low as a single copy. I think this is important; you could say, paradoxically, that everything worth publishing is unpublishable. Much of the best culture doesn’t make back the costs of its production.

...

You can’t say the word “generative” without thinking of Eno. Here are a couple of quotes from him:

“I felt that what was very interesting to do as a composer was to construct some kind of system or process which did the composing for you. You’d then feed inputs into it, and it would reconfigure it and make something beyond what you had predicted,” he says.

“I worked on things like that for a while: Music for Airports and Discreet Music were examples, but what they represented were recordings of these processes in action. What I really wanted to do was to be able to sell the process to somebody, not just my output of it.” Eno went on to design generative music apps like Bloom and Scape.

On the same model, can we expect Faber’s next step to be an app that generates algorhithmically the great experimental Modernist literature Britain should have had?

I know that when I die the first line in my obituary is going to include the phrases &quot;securities fraud&quot; and &quot;banned for life.&quot; It would not be inaccurate to call me the poster boy for the kind of insider dealing and duplicity that made Americans realize just how rigged the game is against them. In fact, you could say that I'm the guy who caused the financial crisis and all the suffering we are still going through five years later. Sure, it would be overblown and largely inaccurate, needlessly overdramatizing a minor issue just to get attention and maybe make a point, but still, you could say it. I mean, yes, the fact that I have been able to move on to my current career, and to do quite well from it, is a testament to the total decline in the traditional concepts of personal responsibility and moral behavior to which the men of every preceding generation in this country had to adhere if they wanted to consider themselves decent human beings. Thirty years ago someone found culpable of the kinds of gross fraud and deceit I perpetrated would have thrown themselves out a window or gassed themselves in a garage, and while people would have shook their heads and muttered a few things about how awful suicide is, deep down they would have thought, &quot;Well, good for him; at least in the end he did the only right and honorable thing he could have done.&quot; But today, so long as you have a total lack of shame about your actions, not only can you survive the justified opprobrium of society, you can do quite well from it. It's weirdly freeing: Once you realize that, for the rest of your life, everyone is going to point fingers at you in the public square and hiss, &quot;Scumbag,&quot; having them also think you're an idiot is a small price to pay, particularly if you can monetize that imbecility. Is there a sweeter revenge than coming to the point where your personage is so tarnished that even you stop caring what people think of you? Once you get past the very real truth that everyone thinks you're a vile, disgusting human being you can let yourself do almost anything without worrying that people will laugh at you. So what if they laugh? More money for me! Admit it, you even occasionally entertain a grudging admiration for my talents. Some days you find yourself envious of my ability to go about life with a complete disregard for the utter lack of esteem every even marginally respectable person in the world holds for me.

I show that these models derive from opposing assumptions about the nature of the software-debugging task. I then make a sustained argument from the Linux experience for the proposition that ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow'', suggest productive analogies with other self-correcting systems of selfish agents, and conclude with some exploration of the implications of this insight for the future of software.

As Variety reports, the website features thousands of rare and out-of-print LPs, 78s and 45s in a new digital download section called Vinyl Vaults.

“We’ve been digitizing a lot,” co-owner Jim Henderson tells Variety. “What you see now is the lost-between-the-cracks, underappreciated, undervalued (music) from dead labels, (obscure) artists, stuff that we really stand behind. It’s mostly in the rock genre, with a lot of jazz, a lot of blues, some country, some spoken word. There are some oddities for sure.”

Amoeba is remastering much of the music, and while there are only about 1,000 titles for sale right now, they are adding 10 or 15 more every day. Some artists or labels are so long-lost that they have been impossible to track down, leading Amoeba to set aside money from such sales in an escrow account. “If (someone says), ‘That’s mine,’ well, OK, we can either take it down or we’ll sell it, and you’ve got this nice (digital) master. We’ll sell it, we’ll promote it; let’s sign a contract,” explains co-owner Marc Weinstein.

The retooled website launched in beta form last year. The site now offers a range of digital downloads, including “curatorial data” in the form of 4,500 artist bios and 6,500 record reviews. The in-house project has taken six years, cost an estimated $11 million, and has employed about 200 people." tag="archiving music vinyl copyright rad" hash="d0eac0b6e6d31b3707090f1b53a5058f" meta="ff13eb0a379c04c68c2924b1822b6953"    />

Rabin and Richard M. Karp in 1987 that uses hashing to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text. For text of length n and p patterns of combined length m, its average and best case running time is O(n+m) in space O(p), but its worst-case time is O(nm). In contrast, the Aho–Corasick string matching algorithm has asymptotic worst-time complexity O(n+m) in space O(m).
A practical application of Rabin–Karp is detecting plagiarism. Given source material, Rabin–Karp can rapidly search through a paper for instances of sentences from the source material, ignoring details such as case and punctuation. Because of the abundance of the sought strings, single-string searching algorithms are impractical." tag="search wikipedia algorithm computer.science" hash="0adda86ed52560e0d747a33e9fbcd056" meta="4ffaacafd80439c9d8696d8436a53db8"    />

Roughly the size of a pack of cigarettes the device has only one toggle switch to cycle through samples, a combined power and dial and an integrated speaker. The device contains a chip holding nine digitally-encoded (drones) ranging in length from 1.5 to 40 seconds. The name and idea derived from a popular Chinese device that intones repeating loops of Buddhist chanting. In an interview with the public radio show Studio 360 regarding the creation of the Buddha Machine, Virant said he was inspired by a device found in a Buddhist temple. Attracted to its design, he applied it as a means of presenting his loop-based music.

Following the original, two new editions of the Buddha Machine have been released: the second unit, released in 2008, features nine new loops and pitch control. The third unit (entitled Chan Fang 禅房; translated as Zen Room) and released in 2010, replaced the electronic drones on the first units with loops performed on the Gu Qin, an ancient Chinese classical instrument. Following these new releases, the band also produced iPhone and iPad apps that have similar functionality to the physical devices. In November 2012, the fourth generation Buddha Machine was released, containing 8 new loops and shipped with one of four day-glo case colours." tag="ambient music loops electronic china" hash="d75e11ac2dbb086fd7b67c6aefa2272a" meta="ac2ee3cdc60b07d8543ab290e7fad93e"    />

It has been discussed in literature since 1972 when the sentence was used by William J. Rapaport, an associate professor at the University at Buffalo. It was posted to Linguist List by Rapaport in 1992. It was also featured in Steven Pinker's 1994 book The Language Instinct as an example of a sentence that is &quot;seemingly nonsensical&quot; but grammatical. Pinker names his student Annie Senghas as the inventor of the sentence.

The sentence's intended meaning becomes clearer when it's understood that it uses the city of Buffalo, New York and the somewhat-uncommon verb &quot;to buffalo&quot; (meaning &quot;to bully or intimidate&quot;), and when the punctuation and grammar is expanded so that the sentence reads as follows: &quot;Buffalo buffalo that Buffalo buffalo buffalo, buffalo Buffalo buffalo.&quot; The meaning becomes even clearer when synonyms are used: &quot;Buffalo-origin bison that other Buffalo bison intimidate, themselves bully Buffalo bison.&quot;" tag="english language linguistics wikipedia grammar" hash="7b6a6b47e7943997c134de75f9a9b903" meta="55c5c7a9d677b51c8f7e67a0668f8860"    />

There have been quite a few theories circulating recently on what will come after post-modernism. Is it the technology-based artistic “movement” The New Aesthetic? Have we, as Prince Rama argue, entered the age of ghost-modernism, one where the art of the past is constantly haunting the present ? I think that Lil B’s work fits best into another theory about our era, the concept of “hypermodernity,” which posits a sort of exponential escalation in the production and connectivity of culture, overwhelming us and producing a new kind of relationship between artists and their work, fans and the art they love. As Nitsuh Abebe pointed out in a column he wrote a few years ago, however, such a state of affairs in art isn’t really that revolutionary: “This ongoing-stream version of following music is a good match for how people experience life and consume information. It's actually the same vantage on pop music that's always been held-- by radio listeners, party regulars, mixtape shoppers, pop-chart followers, folks everywhere. Packets and bursts and narratives.”  Lil B is an avatar for our hyperstimulated consciousness." tag="lilb based hiphop music" hash="92809c7f32317b45d6946d2d2555d3ca" meta="c0b8eb6714d51a37ccdc6a251735d338"    />

We wanted something that had a life and narrative of its own: a journal whose primary mode is the internet, and whose most ideal form is A) a downloadable quarterly journal and B) “supernote”-heavy online articles, where we’re trying to push the boundaries of what archive-based narrative history can do.

...

The web is remarkably good at taking “weird, interesting, lost bits” and turning them into new things, without context—or blowing them up to be even weirder than they are. We’ve been thinking of ourselves as a place for the other “nine-tenths” of history, but presented with the sort of context, narrative, and presentation that suggests that these “lost bits” are strange, but also deeply human parts of history. We’re always looking for odd new sources and the best way to get them up on the web—but we’re trying not to lose the stories behind them, the textures in which we found them. So in a way, we’re not just trying to get the grave’s contents up onto The Appendix—but the grave itself as well." tag="writing publishing history development diy" hash="aa86f978a9c6e7248422594eb0136bae" meta="1d1b7b68f3a2f5360f665804ed1bf4bc"    />

1/2 cup olive oil, divided
4 large links of sweet Italian sausage, casings removed (I used half of this, preferring the sausage to not dominate the soup’s flavor)
1 medium onion, diced
2 celery stalks, sliced or diced
2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced into half-moons or diced
4 cloves garlic, sliced (reserve half for later in recipe)
Kosher salt
A pinch of crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
1 cup brown lentils, sorted and rinsed
2 bay leaves
1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
6 cups water
Freshly ground black pepper
3 to 4 cups shredded or thinly ribboned Swiss chard leaves or kale
Grated Pecorino Romano cheese to finish

Heat 1/4 cup olive oil (enough to coat bottom of pot) in a large pot on medium heat. When hot, add the sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon until it starts to brown, about five minutes. Add the onion, celery, carrots, first two garlic cloves, a pinch fo salt, and if you like your soup spicy, a pinch of red pepper flakes. Cook with the sausage until the vegetables soften a bit, another 5 minutes. Add the lentils, bay leaves, tomatoes, water, more salt and black pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and allow to cook until the lentils are tender, about 40 minutes. (It might be necessary to add more water if the soup gets too thick, though we preferred ours on the thick side.)

When the lentils are cooked, add the chard and cook until the leaves are tender, just a few minutes more. Discard the bay leaves.

To finish, divide soup among bowls, then add the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and 2 garlic cloves to a small skillet and heat over medium until the garlic softens and hisses. Drizzle this over soup bowls, and top with fresh Romano, passing more at the table. Leftovers will keep for several days in the fridge." tag="recipes cooking soup chard winter kale sausage lentils" hash="83910ac106167f8ba7d3b6d6661fc225" meta="0446fca46df8708c941dc0ac3e63d170"    />

At issue is the code created during the Obama for America (OFA) 2012 campaign: the digital architecture behind the campaign’s website, its system for collecting donations, its email operation, and its mobile app. When the campaign ended, these programmers wanted to put their work back into the coding community for other developers to study and improve upon. Politicians in the Democratic party felt otherwise, arguing that sharing the tech would give away a key advantage to the Republicans. Three months after the election, the data and software is still tightly controlled by the president and his campaign staff, with the fate of the code still largely undecided. It’s a choice the OFA developers warn could not only squander the digital advantage the Democrats now hold, but also severely impact their ability to recruit top tech talent in the future." tag="politics obama opensource software technology" hash="5864374096b20c474da118299d7ac5f8" meta="040c38e2f688d8ed04a936c0d9d60baf"    />

But I argue that CSS is not only on the critical path, it is the critical path. And because it's a jungle (network, 3g, edge) out there, anything on the critical path will fail. Guaranteed.

So if you worry about performance, you should get the CSS out of the way as soon as possible. Get off the critical path.

- Put stylesheets at the top of a document
- Put JavaScript at the bottom (where possible)
- Make as few HTTP requests as possible
- Serving assets from multiple domains can increase the number of assets a browser can download in parallel.

DNS lookups are expensive, so you need to determine which is more suitable for your site; the overhead of lookups or just serving everything from one domain.

...

CSS TIPS

- Never serve it from a static/asset domain because this can incur DNS lookups that further delay rendering.
- Serve it early so the browser can get on with things.
- Concatenate it. Because a browser will fetch all CSS anyway, you’re better off squishing it all into the same HTTP request.
- Gzip and minify it so that the browser has less to download.

According to a Pew survey last month, more than a quarter of all adults used the Internet at a library during the past year. The numbers are higher for blacks and Latinos than they are for whites. Indeed, whites may not know or understand how important library Internet access is to minorities: 92 percent of blacks and 86 percent of Latinos said it was very important for libraries to offer free access to computers and the Internet, while only 72 percent of whites did.

...

And because almost a third of Americans (again, more blacks and Latinos than whites) don't subscribe to our country's expensive Internet access at home, librarians say that they're scrambling to fill the gap left by our nation's yawning digital divide.

<post href="http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/the-real-20-most-influential-beers-of-all-time/" time="2013-01-18T19:06:25Z" description="The REAL 20 most influential beers of all time | Zythophile" extended="1 Spaten Dunkel The lagering techniques Gabriel Sedlmayr perfected at the family brewery in Munich, and the yeast that he used and then so generously donated to brewers from Carlsberg in Denmark to Heineken in the Netherlands were what powered the lager revolution in Europe and around the world. Without the work done at the Spaten brewery, there would have been no Pilsner Urquell. But the original Spaten lager (and indeed the first lagers brewed outside Bavaria) were all dark beers, little known by modern drinkers, which is why their importance has been forgotten.

2 Pilsner Urquell The genius of the men who set up the Burghers’ Brewery in Plsen in 1842 appears to have been in combining Bavarian lager yeast and lagering techniques with pale malt made in the English fashion, to produce the world’s first pale lager. It took another half a century or more for the Pilsner style to triumph over its darker rivals even in continental Europe, but most of the beer drunk in the world today has its roots in Bohemia.

3 Hodgson’s East India Pale Ale There’s a good case for saying that Bass Pale Ale, as the most successful IPA of the 19th and 20th centuries, should fly the flag for the style. But Hodgson’s brewery in Bow, London was the maker of the highly hopped pale beer shipped out east whose success inspired the Burton brewers to follow with their own beers brewed for the Indian trade, beers that later proved popular back home in Britain as well. Therefore it’s Hodgson that deserves to be on the “most influential” list, even though the Bow brewery eventually collapsed into obscurity.

4 Parsons’ porter We have no good evidence as to who, if anyone, first turned London brown beer into what became known as porter: it looks as if the city’s whole brown beer trade slowly moved in the first 30 or so years of the 18th century towards a hoppier, more aged style of dark beer that eventually became hugely popular. But there IS evidence that the pioneer of lengthy storage for porter in huge vats, to perfect its flavour, was Sir Humphrey Parsons, of the Red Lion brewery, by St Katharine’s Dock, to the east of the Tower of London, which would make him the most influential porter brewer, since everybody else copied his idea. And without porter we wouldn’t have stout.

5 Barclay Perkins Russian Imperial Stout A number of London brewers were exporting very strong stouts to the Baltic lands in the 19th century, but Barclay Perkins’s Anchor brewery is the earliest we have evidence for, the best-known and the longest–lasting. Its imperial stout influenced brewers in Poland, the smaller Baltic states and Germany in the 19th century, and American craft brewers in the late 20th and 21st centuries.

6 Schwechater Lagerbier Anton Dreher was a big pal of Gabriel Sedlmayr and accompanied the Bavarian on his “study tours”. At the family brewery in Schwechat, just outside Vienna, Dreher used Sedlmayr’s lagering ideas and, like the brewers in Plsen, malting techniques based on those used by English brewers, though Dreher produced darker malts than the Bohemians, to give a beer halfway in colour between Pilsner and a Munich Dunkel. Think Sam Adams Boston lager, and you’d be about right. Dreher’s is the influence on all those lagers that look more like English bitters in colour.

7 Einbecker Ur-Bock Without the Einbeckers of Lower Saxony, there would be no Bock beers.

8 Paulaner Salvator And without Munich’s Salvator, the first of the souped-up Doppelbocks, we wouldn’t have all those beers ending in -or.

9 Anheuser-Busch Budweiser Come on – of course it was hugely influential. It pioneered national beer distribution around the US, and it set the standard for what American beer was expected to be. You might not like that standard, but millions of drinkers did, and do, in the US and abroad.

10 Bass No 1 Best-known of the strong Burton Ales, this was the beer that other barley wines wanted to be, until number 16 on my list came along.

11 Schneider Weisse Who should carry the banner for Bavarian wheat beer, a style that was restricted to little old Bavarian ladies only 40 years ago but which has since bounced back hugely and now has imitators everywhere? There are several candidates, but I’ll give it to the guys from Kelheim, because they brew nothing else.

12 Hoegaarden When it comes to Belgian wheat beer, however, there can be only one original, and all the rest are imitators (even if some now, whisper it, might be doing a better job). When Pierre Celis rescued this style from the grave, he was to have far more influence than he could have possibly imagined.

13 Duvel Anyone brewing a strong, golden Belgian-style ale is bowing towards Breendonk.

14 Fuller’s ESB A winter-only brew to begin with, ESB became famous as the strongest bitter in Britain, and spawned a new style in the US.

15 Newcastle Brown Ale First and best-known of the fruity dark amber “Northern brown ales”.

16 Tennent’s Gold Label The Sheffield brewer Tennent’s launched its golden barley wine more than 60 years ago, inspiring a host of imitators among brewers who had previously believed strong beers had to be dark.

17 Fowler’s Wee Heavy Wee Heavy is a much misunderstood style: it’s not that old and it certainly shouldn’t be made with smoked malt. But Fowler’s is the one everybody copied.

<post href="https://www.docracy.com/3884/contract-of-works-for-web-design" time="2013-01-17T15:48:37Z" description="Contract of Works for Web Design/Development" extended="Between Designer's Name at Company Name and Customer's name 

Summary
We will always do our best to fulfil your needs and meet your goals, but sometimes it is best to have a few simple things written down so that we both know what is what, who should do what and what happens if things go wrong. In this contract you won't find complicated legal terms or large passages of unreadable text. We have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. We do want what's best for the safety of both parties, now and in the future.

In short

You, Customer's name, are hiring Company Name located at Company's Address  to design and develop a web site for the estimated total price of £ Price outlined in our previous correspondence. The agreed payment plan is at the end of the document. 

What do both parties agree to do? 

As our customer, you have the power and ability to enter into this contract on behalf of your company or organization. You agree to provide us with everything that we need to complete the project including text, images and other information as and when we need it, and in the format that we ask for. You agree to review our work, provide feedback and sign-off approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways and you will also be bound by any dates that we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

We have the experience and ability to perform the services you need from us and we will carry them out in a professional and timely manner. Along the way we will endeavour to meet all the deadlines set but we can't be responsible for a missed launch date or a deadline if you have been late in supplying materials or have not approved or signed off our work on-time at any stage. On top of this we will also maintain the confidentiality of any information that you give us.

Details of the works
We will create designs for the look-and-feel, layout and functionality of your web site. This contract includes one main design plus the opportunity for you to make up to two rounds of revisions. If you're not happy with the designs at this stage, you will pay us in full for all of the work that we have produced until that point and you may either cancel this contract or continue to commission us to make further design revisions at the daily rate set out in our original estimate.

HTML/CSS layout templates

If the project includes XHTML or HTML markup and CSS templates, we will develop these using valid HTML5 markup and CSS3 for styling. We will test all our markup and CSS in current versions of all major browsers including those made by Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla and Opera. We will also test to ensure that pages will display visually in a similar, albeit not necessarily an identical way, in Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 for Windows as this browser is now past its sell-by date.

We will not test these templates in old or abandoned browsers, for example Microsoft Internet Explorer 5, 5.5 or 6 for Windows or Mac, previous versions of Apple's Safari, Mozilla Firefox or Opera unless otherwise specified. If you need to show the same or similar visual design to visitors using these older browsers, we will charge you at the daily rate set out in our original estimate for any necessary additional code and its testing.

Text content 

We are not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy unless we specified it in the original estimate. We'll be happy to help though, and in addition to the estimate we will charge you at £ Hourly Copy Fee per hour, including a free initial consultation, for copy writing or content input. 

Photographs 

If needed, you will supply us photographs either in digital or printed format. If you choose to buy stock photographs we can suggest vendors of stock photography. Any time we spend searching for or taking appropriate photographs will be charged at £Hourly Photo Fee per hour, after a free initial consultation to determine if this is the best route to take.

Changes and revisions 

We know from plenty of experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your first idea about how something should look, or how it might work. We don't want to limit  either your options or your opportunities to change your mind.

The estimate/quotation prices at the beginning of this document are based on the number of days that we estimate we'll need to accomplish everything that you have told us you want to achieve. If you do want to change your mind, add extra pages or templates or even add new functionality, that won't be a problem. You will be charged the daily rate set out in the estimate we gave you. Along the way we might ask you to put requests in writing so we can keep track of changes.

Technical support 

You may already have professional web site hosting, you might even manage that hosting in-house; if that's the case, great. If you don't manage your own web site hosting, we can set up an account for you at one of our preferred, third-party hosting providers. We will charge you a one-off fee for installing your site on this server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics; then the updates to, and management of that server, plus any support issues will be up to you.

We are not a web site hosting company and so we do not offer or include technical support for web site hosting, email or other services relating to web site hosting. If you do require help with anything beyond the design and development of your site, we'll be happy to help.

Legal stuff 
We can't guarantee that the functions contained in any web page templates or in a completed web site will always be error-free and so we can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate this web site and any other web pages, even if you have advised us of the possibilities of such damages.

If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Copyrights 
You guarantee to us that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide us for inclusion in the web site are either owned by your good selfs, or that you have permission to use them. 

When we receive your final payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows: 

You own the graphics and other visual elements that we create for you for this project. We will give you a copy of all files and you should store them really safely as we are not required to keep them or provide any native source files that we used in making them. 

You also own text content, photographs and other data you provided, unless someone else owns them. We own the XHTML markup, CSS and other code and we license it to you for use on only this project.

Payments 
We are sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly.  As we're also sure you'll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule, which will be as follows, but may be revised based on further conversations between us.

50% of total estimated fee upon agreement of initial design: £Deposit Fee

Remainder of fee payable not more than 14 days after receipt of finished product: £Remainder of Fee

Interest accrued if payment is more than 14 days late is 5% of outstanding amount to be added every 7 days, starting from 15th day after receipt of finished product.

But where is all the horrible small print?

On a whim or the turn of a phrase, I can leap from Shakespeare to Soyinka, finding similarities that didn’t exist before, or else existed but were yet unknown. In exchange for the loss of continuity, I gain a new space for metaphors: no longer within the texts, but between them.

If that’s the case, then the promise of an ebook is in the multiplicity of titles, not the single text. And, furthermore, it is in the avenues and alleys that lead from one text to the other—in the official tree-lined roads as well as the dank, handmade tunnels. It’s the card catalog—as much as the books themselves—that earn their rescue from the fire.

...

I wonder, then, if the promise of an ebook isn’t the book but the library. And if, in all our attention to a new device for reading, we’re neglecting methods for shelving. A search engine cannot compete with Warburg’s delicate, personal library. The metadata of a book extends beyond the keywords held between its covers to the many hands the text has passed through; it’s not enough just to scan every page. We need to also scan the conversations, the notes left in the margins, the stains from coffee, tea, and drink. We need to eavesdrop on the readers, without whom every book is mute.

The first contact between indigenous civilizations of Mesoamerica and Europeans took place during his reign, and he was killed during the initial stages of the Spanish conquest of Mexico, when Conquistador Hernán Cortés and his men fought to escape from the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan.

During his reign the Aztec Empire reached its maximal size. Through warfare, Moctezuma expanded the territory as far south as Xoconosco in Chiapas and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and incorporated the Zapotec and Yopi people into the empire. He changed the previous meritocratic system of social hierarchy and widened the divide between pipiltin (nobles) and macehualtin (commoners) by prohibiting commoners from working in the royal palaces.

The portrayal of Moctezuma in history has mostly been colored by his role as ruler of a defeated nation, and many sources describe him as weak-willed and indecisive.

The question stayed with me—do you have to go to the bathroom and eat to be alive?—because Breazeal’s obvious intent was to pick what she considered the most base part of life, to make it seem ridiculous, humiliating even. But after a while I came to the conclusion: maybe yes. Given the amount of time living creatures devote to food and its attendant states—food! the stuff that sustains us—I decided that, yes, there might be something crucial about the necessities of eating and eliminating that defines us. How much of our state of being is dependent upon being hungry, eating, having eaten, being full, shitting. Hunger! Our word for everything from nourishment to passionate desire. Satisfied! Meaning everything from well-fed to sexually fulfilled to mentally soothed. Shit! Our word for human waste and our expletive of impatience. The more I thought about it, the more I decided that there are huge swaths of existence that would be impenetrable- indescribable, unprogrammable, utterly unable to be represented—to a creature that did not eat or shit.

...

AI researchers who are looking at social life are certainly on the right path in the search to understand sentience. But until they grasp the centrality of identity, I don’t think they’ll find what they’re looking for. And then, of course, even supposing they grant that there is something called an identity, a unique constellation of body and experience that somehow makes a creature a someone, a self—even then, they’ll still have to find a way to program it.

Their task in simulating a self-identifying sentient creature will be a little like trying to simulate a hurricane. Think about how weather simulations work. Unable to take into account all of the complexity that goes into the production of weather (the whole world, essentially), simulations use some subset of that complexity and are able to do a fairly good job of predicting what will happen in the next hours or days. But as you move out in time, or at the extremes of weather, the model breaks down. After three days, the predictions begin to fail; after ten, the simulation no longer works at all. The fiercer the storm, the less useful the simulation. Hurricanes are not something you predict; they’re something you watch. And that is what human sentience is: a hurricane—too complex to understand fully by rational means, something we observe, marvel at, fear. In the end we give up and call it an “act of God.”

Saunders has taught in the graduate writing program at Syracuse for 16 years. I spent a couple of days sitting in on his classes, a small five-student workshop and a “forms” class, which on the day I was there was focused on the nature of revision; specifically, on a handful of Raymond Carver stories and the fraught relationship between Carver and his editor, Gordon Lish. The students seemed really sharp, and Saunders is clearly committed to them. “With this caliber of student, you have to be really honest,” he told me. “It keeps you looking at your own process, so you don’t import any nonsense.” In an interview several years ago with Ben Marcus for The Believer, Saunders defended the time spent in an M.F.A. program by saying, “The chances of a person breaking through their own habits and sloth and limited mind to actually write something that gets out there and matters to people are slim.” But it’s a mistake, he added, to think of writing programs in terms that are “too narrowly careerist. . . . Even for those thousands of young people who don’t get something out there, the process is still a noble one — the process of trying to say something, of working through craft issues and the worldview issues and the ego issues — all of this is character-building, and, God forbid, everything we do should have concrete career results. I’ve seen time and time again the way that the process of trying to say something dignifies and improves a person.”" tag="reading books literature" hash="89a16993ed27f32f7d0da86c1688b97a" meta="c37dc9e75fa4c007ab36ea83d8a94648"    />

WordNet superficially resembles a thesaurus, in that it groups words together based on their meanings. However, there are some important distinctions. First, WordNet interlinks not just word forms—strings of letters—but specific senses of words. As a result, words that are found in close proximity to one another in the network are semantically disambiguated. Second, WordNet labels the semantic relations among words, whereas the groupings of words in a thesaurus does not follow any explicit pattern other than meaning similarity." tag="dictionary english language linguistics reference thesaurus" hash="cfc685f49840fce71808b38f4efa50ce" meta="b8d17645c849ba1f548d96f09a54d45a"    />

While not yet a continuous trail, relying on road walks in some areas, it nevertheless takes in many of the popular hiking attractions west of the Hudson River, such as the New Jersey Palisades, Harriman State Park, the Shawangunk Ridge and the Catskill Mountains. It offers hikers a diversity of environments to pass through, from suburbia and sea-level salt marshes along the Hudson to wilderness and boreal forest on Catskill summits 4,000 feet (1219 m) in elevation.

When conceived in the 1930s, it was to be the antithesis of a hiking trail, with neither a designated route nor blazes, simply a list of points of interest hikers could find their own routes to. However, increasing development after World War II in Orange and Rockland counties made that less workable, and it was revived in the 1960s as a standard trail.

You imagine the most skeptical coder challenging you after you describe a feature, approach, API , etc. but they don’t just stop with the first “why”. You answer it, and then they ask, “Who Cares?”, and when you answer THAT , they ask, “so what?”. When you have finished imagining this chain, you usually have a much more powerful and motivating reason (or, you realize there IS no compelling reason or use case because you could not come up with answers for all three challenges). We now suggest that technical authors constantly run through the who-who cares-so what when writing, and it works quite powerfully for those writing marketing copy as well. Way too often, people stop at the first why (or sooner), but that thing they finally say in exasperation with the final “so?” yeah, THAT ’s where you get to the meaty core of the why, and usually it’s more motivating and powerful. Regardless, it’s surprising how little the true “why” is even given a nod whether in technical docs or marketing.

1. Use CSS keyframe animation or CSS transitions, if at all possible. The browser can optimize painting and compositing bigtime here.
2. If needs to be it's JS-based animation, use requestAnimationFrame. Avoid setTimeout, setInterval.
3. Avoid changing inline styles on every frame (jQuery animate()-style) if you can, declarative animations in CSS can be optimized by the browser way more.
4. Using 2D transforms instead of absolute positioning will typically provide better FPS by way of smaller paint times and smoother animation.

The proliferation of printing technology meant that “an increasing number of readers became writers”—in publications’ letters-to-the-editor sections and in pamphlets (and, much later, in zines and blogs). Benjamin concluded that “the distinction between author and public is about to lose its basic character.” He made similar predictions about film and music.

Although he made his living as a writer, Benjamin embraced this increasing participation of the masses in art-making (and his hopes for film may be realized in our lifetimes). He thought that active engagement by as many people as possible was good for society, and made for better art. Time and again, he disparaged artists who sought to protect their privileged social spaces, whose politics never went beyond sympathy to an actual practice of engagement with the public.

But Benjamin was optimistic about automated cultural production because he connected it to particular types of social transformation. He believed the massification of artistic production would mean the proletarianization of artists. As more people made art, artists would find themselves a part of the masses, without a specialized “position between the classes.” Artistic production, steeped in a radical mass movement, would more authentically represent the aims of the working class and integrate with political praxis instead of just political ideology. To borrow Bourriaud’s distinction, art would exist for use rather than contemplation.

1. Initial HTML page is downloaded
During this phase, most of the time, the browser downloads the initial HTML page on a new TCP connection. That new TCP connection needs to be careful not to send more data than the physical link can handle, so it uses its slow-start mechanism. This means that, during this phase, if the browser needs to measure the effective bandwidth it’s got, it will significantly underestimate the available bandwidth. When we’re discussing bandwidth media queries, this phase is the critical one. When the browser needs to decide which resources to download according to the media query, this measurement is most likely the only bandwidth measurement that the browser will have with this particular server.

2. CSS and JavaScript external resources are loaded.
During this phase, the browser has a collection of new TCP connections, all in their slow-start phase, and they are not all necessarily to the same destination server. Again, estimating bandwidth in this phase is not straightforward.

3. Images are loaded.
Here the browser has multiple connections, each one downloading a resource. The problem is that these connections are not always in the same phase of their life cycle. Some might be in the slow-start phase; some may have suffered a packet loss and, thus, reduced their window and the bandwidth they are trying to fill; and some might be warmed-up TCP connections, ready to fill the bandwidth. These TCP connections are not necessarily all to the same destination server, and the bandwidth towards the various destination servers might be different between one another.

...

Web developers should be able to define image resources of various resolutions, which would later be used by the browser to perform heuristic optimizations. This can be done by a declarative syntax, similar to the syntax of the srcset responsive images proposal. The syntax would define various resources and would hint to the browser which images to use for various criteria, such as screen density and screen size. The browser would then use these hints, but with room left open for further optimizations (related to bandwidth, user preference, data plan costs, you name it).

...

Media queries are necessary when the browser must not be allowed to use heuristics to pick the right image resource to present. One of the best examples of this (and an illustration of one of the biggest shortcomings of the srcset proposal) is the art direction use case. This is the use case where the proposed picture element really shines." tag="responsive mediaqueries images development" hash="c05750ab2d9f64526661295185ef6667" meta="3198c6763b05304b14ac78dd88217141"    />

The recordings on “The 50th Anniversary Collection” were about to fall over that legal precipice.

On maps that are not of streets, other &quot;copyright trap&quot; features (such as nonexistent towns or mountains with the wrong elevations) may be inserted or altered for the same purpose.

Trap streets are often nonexistent streets; but sometimes, rather than actually depicting a street where none exists, a map will misrepresent the nature of a street in a fashion that can still be used to detect copyright violators but is less likely to interfere with navigation. For instance, a map might add nonexistent bends to a street, or depict a major street as a narrow lane, without changing its location or its connections to other streets.

Trap streets are routinely denied and rarely acknowledged by publishers. This is not always the case, however. A popular driver's atlas for the city of Athens, Greece, warns inside its front cover that potential copyright violators should beware of trap streets." tag="copyright maps wikipedia" hash="2ebf0fb7f5958918ef1fabd11315692e" meta="27d7fb7d101bf13ecbeaecf8c16056ea"    />

Which brings us to branches. Nature is full of branches because if you want to be close to a lot of space with minimal increase in your own volume, your best bet is a structure that forks and sub-forks. This is how birds make wings: they send out a bone with a little quick tissue and feather roots, and from them grow rachis, and from them grow barbs, and from them grow barbules, and from them grow barbicels, between which the gaps are so small that air doesn’t bother trying to get through, and the bird has made something the shape of an airfoil without having to fill it with heavy meat. Branching is also how plants fill out their space in the air to collect sunlight and CO2, and underground to find solid nutrients. The structures of your nervous, respiratory, and circulatory systems are similarly manifold.

...

Fluid dynamicists use the phrase viscous fingering to describe this kind of structure in their domain.

...

A sterotype was a block of type fused solid – a backtrack from movable type for the sake of convenience. A newspaper might have a stereotype for the or the name of its town; a jobbing printer might make a stereotype of a client’s business card so it would wear longer without requiring resetting. (There was another word for this kind of object, from French onomatopoeia: cliché.)

Utilities like TextExpander and autocomplete serve a purpose very much like that of stereotypes.

...

People who do not use mass production for their decoration often use roughly space-filling curves: patterns that can be elaborated until they cover their base fabric. It is neither necessary nor sufficient I encourage someone else to write their own speculative nonfiction about why this is. I suspect that William Morris, studies of time use, and a diagram of a loom will feature heavily. to be away from contemporary Western technology to embroider – or paint, or engrave – manifold branches on things, but the correlation seems strong.

...

If no one had heard of the Odyssey, and you tried to publish it today as fiction set in the world of the Greek myths, your editor would probably praise many parts highly, then gently outline some concerns. For starters, it’s about as structured as a handful of sand. Theoretically, the hero is driven by his desire to get home, but this only affects him at random and rarely in interesting ways. For the most part, he’s having entertaining but arbitrary adventures among supporting characters we never get to know. There’s little because … and so … but finally and a whole lot of and then … and then … and then. 

...

The areas with the richest remaining traditions tended to be those with the least state power and the lowest literacy, due to poverty or war. Murko was very explicit that the stories were not fixed things.

...

Various scholars had realized around 1900–1930 that the peculiarities of the Homeric poems were explained perfectly by seeing them as records of a living oral tradition. The repeated images were formulas that the singer, in the moment of singing, knew would bridge a gap in the meter or narrative. The poet had not memorized the text of the poem (because there was no such thing), only its vital shapes and a huge collection of words and techniques for recreating at the pace of speech.

...

In the eastern United States, for example – a lot of what we know about certain oral traditions among slaves comes from right at their end, when they overlapped with writing for a single generation. There was a song that newly ex-slaves composed and recomposed about ambivalence toward death in a time of nominal freedom but great suffering, for example, that was recorded in several quite different versions and we now know as Michael, Row the Boat Ashore. 

...

One of the most studied of these formulas is the Hero on the Beach, in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. It is a moment in which the protagonist stands on a beach, surrounded by companions, in the presence of a light, and begins a journey.

...

The poet Gary Snyder did his undergrad thesis on a Haida story called He Who Hunted Birds in His Father’s Village, which various people had pointed out was startlingly parallel to the swan-maiden folktale of Central Europe. In fact these both belong to a category of animal wife stories that vary by region – seals in Northern Europe, cranes in East Asia, buffalo in Central Africa, and so on. I assume that if we could say what these stories mean, if it were as simple as young men coming to terms with the otherness of women or something, we would already have spelled it out and wouldn’t need all the different stories.

Old Tjikko is estimated to be at least 9,550 years old, making it the world's oldest known individual vegetatively cloned tree. It stands 5 metres (16 ft) tall and is located on Fulufjället Mountain of Dalarna province in Sweden. For thousands of years, the tree appeared in a stunted shrub formation (also known as a krummholz formation) due to the harsh extremes of the environment in which it lives. During the warming of the last century, the tree has sprouted into a normal tree formation. The man who discovered the tree, Leif Kullman (Professor of Physical Geography at Umeå University), has attributed this growth spurt to global warming, and given the tree its nickname &quot;Old Tjikko&quot; after his late dog." tag="trees nature rad old sweden wikipedia" hash="af2c8bac44ad6731b301b77d52bb24d6" meta="88549aa90698a47dd2397cab5d65abfe"    />

The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old, is among the oldest known living organisms.

Pando is located in the Fishlake National Forest, near Fish Lake at the western edge of the Colorado Plateau in South-central Utah.

...

During intense fires, the organism survived underground, with its root system sending up new stems in the aftermath of each wildfire.

- Optimize an existing feature or asset on the page 
- Remove an existing feature or asset from the page 
- Don’t add the new feature or asset

This is the fundamental issue at the heart of the artworld’s grappling with digital / net art, it’s the issue at the heart of our conceptual problems with ebooks, it’s the fundamental basis for thinking about the New Aesthetic. The post-internet crowd know this: this is what post-internet means. Because we’ve been treating the internet as a medium like photography or sculpture or painting. The internet is not a medium: it is a context.

...

What this is, what the New Aesthetic is, is an attempt to do what I have been thinking of as long-form writing online; that is, writing with the same range of argument and continuity of thought as book writing, but inhabiting the network, natural to it and fluent in it. Writing with a disposition, just as Dronestagram has a disposition, that is shaped as information, mobile and replicable.

...

What this returns me to—the perceived, spam-like qualities of these niche, networked literatures, the echoes and re-echoes of a network-mediated music—is tools and tool-making, but a cyborg tool-making, a tight binding. Marshall Macluhan wrote “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us”, but he wrote it in 1964. The tools have evolved and we have co-evolved with them, each acting upon the other. As the distance between us and the network decreases, the tool-making iterates in a constant back-and-forth, ever closer, ever tighter.

“I’m sure Jimi Hendrix had a very intimate relationship with his guitar, but it’s also very different when the instrument you use is the same that you Skype your mom on, and get really good or bad news on – it’s just such an intimate, integrated part of your lifestyle in a way that I don’t think has ever been possible before, and so if that could somehow be communicated, I think it would be really interesting. I’m trying to explore that now, to get at the crux of the intimacy we have with our technology, because so many people really cast it in this light of the laptop being cold. I really think it’s a fallacy the way people cast technology in this light and then cast acoustic or even analogue instruments in this warm, human light, because I don’t understand what would be more human between a block of wood and something that was also created by humans, for humans.” -- Holly Herndon" tag="internet newaesthetic reading tools writing music" hash="ad382b23fa0c5804c054781d8372e220" meta="29e30489cf48cbf523e44e040f89dd9f"    />

...

The JavaScript community is too quick to dismiss syntax sugar. I think syntax sugar creates expressiveness. The same way you abstract repeating logic in your code, your language ought to abstract common idioms.

1. It makes the code more concise.
2. It helps communicate the meaning behind your code rather than the algorithm. I already know the array iteration algorithm, thank you very much. Stop repeating it and just tell me what you are trying to do.

...

JavaScript's object model is not enough. Prototypal inheritance is a low level feature that can be used to create a meaningful object model, but in no way constitutes one by itself.&quot;

Copy the Private Clone URL from this new repo. Add the public Gist as a remote in your cloned copy of the private Gist, and push to it. (You'll need to do a forced push since the public Gist has the dummy file in it.)

They are hybrid, unformed, inconclusive—inconclusive not in the sense of vague, but their conclusions are not located exclusively within the work, but are distributed across the network.

Books that do work. These are working books in the sense of working definitions: they are arguing towards something, although that something is inconclusive by the above definition. (“Working definition” is related to the “overlapping consensus”.)

Two black cloth ears may be sewn onto the cloth. The eye sockets are often filled with green bottle-ends, or other coloured material. The lower jaw is sometimes spring-loaded, so that the Mari's 'operator' can snap it at passers-by or householders. Coloured ribbons are usually fixed to the skull and small bells attached to the reins (if any) by which the Mari is led.

It’s an attempt to freeze the system, to declare it complete and contained, an automaton, but this is anti-network, and the paucity of its thinking is revealed by the network. The failure takes many forms, but it’s a contextual failure. You have to include the demon in the system, you have to include the man in the box.

The New Aesthetic has been repeatedly and roundly criticised for not stating itself clearly in a way that old frameworks, artistic and academic, may get their heads around; but also for romanticising “robots”, a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between reifying the machine and attributing agency to the machine as paranoiac-critical method, as spatial analysis. There is no romanticisation here. Of course the gaze of the machine is our gaze too: this is what a literacy of the network attempts to articulate, this is what we are attempting to point at — from the inside.

I’ve spent plenty of time articulating the cognitive dissonances of electronic books: this is what is happening to everything. The cognitive dissonance of time, what some people have called atemporality, which appears as hauntology, and which I sometimes prefer to think of as simultaneity or network realism. Atemporality is not an aesthetic, its the affect of this condition.

Everything constructed, building towards this point. Everything undermined, ready to pull it all down as soon as the moment is upon us. Like those old Quaker meeting houses with the single point, the central pin, which when removed would collapse the house and thus remove the grounds for prosecution under unlawful assembly acts. Or the business of setting up meeting houses at a crossroad, so the congregation could call from window to window, hold a service in common without violating the same laws.

50. Someone who's just been signed.

49. Someone who's already been dropped. 

48. Rapper who has done things that would make Chris Brown cut off his dick in shame, but because they're not to anyone famous, they still count towards his grizzled street cred with Pitchfork readers who are too scared and confused by WSHH to get their news from source.

47. Whatever Thom Yorke has blessed this year.

46. &quot;Never heard of it.&quot;

45. &quot;I've heard of it, but not actually gotten around to hearing it yet.&quot;

44. &quot;Worst thing I've ever heard.&quot;

43. Kendrick Lamar.

42. Band who mistakenly believed they'd be given a big post-Olympics popularity boost by their very public decision to tell Danny Boyle and his Opening Ceremony to go fuck themselves.

41. Artist whose raw public confession of homosexuality wasn't quite as good as Frank Ocean's because he had the misfortune not to work in a genre that hates gays.

40. Peaking Lights

39. Woman compared to Kate Bush because of key overlaps: 1) being a woman, 2) singing, 3) giving the impression that she has difficulty coping with life.

38. Woman praised in copy for &quot;striking a blow for modern femininity&quot;, a blow that so far consists of making mediocre indie-pop about past boyfriends.

37. Mac DeMarco

36. Album that everyone suddenly seems to be talking about like they've been into it for ages, despite the fact that you've never heard anyone other than the Quietus say a damned word about it, and never will again after 31 December.

35 – 31. Five acts who have all slept with someone who has slept with Swim Deep.

30. People voting for Django Django who meant to vote for Alt-J.

29. People voting for Alt-J who meant to vote for Django Django.

28. Act who changed name and moved to Montreal to make deep house two years after changing name and moving to Brooklyn to make witch garage two years after moving to Portland to make Apple advert indie.

27. Band who had the good fortune to be alphabetised in everyone's iTunes immediately after Grimes, leading to crucial &quot;left it running&quot; plays.

26. The much-feted return of a &quot;living legend&quot; who, despite enjoying a good feting, has mainly spent the past few months praying that no one finds out what happened in his Top Of The Pops dressing room in March 1973.

25. A &quot;shadowy&quot; post-dubstep producer, who spends his days cold-calling pensioners on behalf of EDF Energy.

24. Artist whom music journalists have decided to love because their former career as a journalist means that there's still hope for everyone's thwarted and stalled creative ambitions, #GodGetMeOutOfThisWakingNightmare.

23. Something on Not Not Fun that was recorded in a pristine, state of the art studio – in which the band were playing next door in the bogs for that authentic lo-fi sound.

22. Someone who might have been in Odd Future, but trying to deny it now.

21. Canadians making Canadian Music.

20. Toy

19. A bunch of super-smart, snot-nosed, wet behind the balls students whose lyrics seem to infer that they have had sexual intercourse, whereas one listen to the way they sing them confirms that they surely haven't.

18. Album that writer breathlessly describes as having &quot;deconstructed pop&quot;, but which simply reflects the fact that said writer doesn't listen to much pop nowadays and is astonished at genre-blending that anyone with a working knowledge of Radio 1 will have long since taken as standard.

17. Beach House

16. Someone who once shared a cab with Kevin Parker.

15. Band who have released an &quot;amusingly arch&quot; record that they'd be mortified to hear described as such, because in fact they were being deadly serious and are just incredibly pretentious.

14. Bob Dylan or Leonard Cohen

13. Fiona Apple or Cat Power

12. Dirty Projectors or David Byrne

11. &quot;Sun-dappled dream-popper&quot; who in truth only ever dreams about killing animals with a spade.

10. The xx or Chromatics

9. Album whose appraisal involved the editor having to do a ctrl+F to make damn sure she'd rooted out every last appearance of the word &quot;shimmering&quot;.

8. Space reserved for old black legend being rebooted for modern coffee tables by Richard Russell.

<post href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/" time="2012-11-27T15:33:27Z" description="ECMAScript Language Specification - ECMA-262 Edition 5.1" extended="This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company’s Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0.

The development of this Standard started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.

That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in nature.

The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of forthcoming internationalisation facilities and future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002.

Since publication of the third edition, ECMAScript has achieved massive adoption in conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become the programming language that is supported by essentially all web browsers. Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. Although that work was not completed and not published as the fourth edition of ECMAScript, it informs continuing evolution of the language. The fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5th edition) codifies de facto interpretations of the language specification that have become common among browser implementations and adds support for new features that have emerged since the publication of the third edition. Such features include accessor properties, reflective creation and inspection of objects, program control of property attributes, additional array manipulation functions, support for the JSON object encoding format, and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security.

It’s the easiest way to make an Old Thing feel like a New Thing. The more difficult exercise is to reconsider the product in the context of now. A now which may be very different from the then in which the product was originally conceived.

...

I propose Subcompact Publishing tools and editorial ethos begin (but not end) with the following qualities:

Small issue sizes (3-7 articles / issue)
Small file sizes
Digital-aware subscription prices
Fluid publishing schedule
Scroll (don’t paginate)
Clear navigation
HTML(ish) based
Touching the open web

...

No pagination is vastly superior to pagination done poorly.

...

Take all of our digital publishing nuts and springs, bits and bolts and spread them out on the old table. Climb our ladder and look down and ask yourself:

For the brussels sprouts:
1 1/2 cups trimmed, halved brussels sprouts
2 cups peeled butternut squash, cut into 1-inch asymmetrical chunks
2 cups (about 1 large) Honeycrisp, Cortland, or Granny Smith apple, cored and cut into 1-inch asymmetrical chunks
1 shallot, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices
2 tablespoons olive oil
5 fresh sage leaves
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 tablespoon maple syrup
 
For the walnuts (purchased candied walnuts may be substituted):
6 cups vegetable or canola oil, or as needed for frying
6 ounces walnut halves
2 cups confectioners’ sugar
Kosher salt
Walnut bread, for serving (optional)
Procedures
1
For the brussels sprouts: Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a large, shallow baking dish, toss the brussels sprouts, butternut squash, apples, and shallot with the olive oil and sage leaves. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bake without stirring until the vegetables and apples are wrinkled, slightly brown, and the edges of the squash are beginning to crisp, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare the walnuts.

2
For the walnuts: Place a deep fryer or high-sided saucepan over high heat, and add vegetable or canola oil to come no closer than 3 inches from the top of the pot; when the walnuts are added, the oil will bubble and rise. Heat to 375°F. If using a saucepan, reduce the heat to very low to hold the temperature.

3
In a medium pot over high heat, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the walnuts and boil for 10 seconds. Drain well and immediately toss with the confectioners’ sugar. Spread flat on a baking sheet and allow to dry for a few minutes.

4
Have a baking sheet lined with paper towels nearby. Confirm that the temperature of the oil is 375°F, adjusting as needed. Working in batches if necessary, add the walnuts and stir once or twice. Fry until amber-brown, about 30 seconds. Using a wire skimmer or heatproof slotted spoon, remove from the oil and transfer to paper towels. Sprinkle lightly with salt and allow to cool for 5 minutes before handling. May be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

5
To serve: Remove the vegetables from the oven, drizzle with maple syrup, and sprinkle with 2 to 3 tablespoons of halved or roughly crumbled walnut pieces. Serve with walnut bread, if desired." tag="food fall recipes vegetables" hash="651dd70ef39cfd0d3d49a99e502e5afb" meta="11e457b468fee3e52894bc0c843b7785"    />

New apartment, office, and government buildings regularly rise up over older neighborhoods, and thousands have relocated to modern housing complexes.

(James’s thesis that this obliviousness correlates to a sense of special entitlement is corroborated by my own observation that the crowd on Amtrak, where airline-level fares act as a de facto class barrier, is generally louder and more inconsiderate than the supposed riffraff on the bus.) It’s a pathology that seems increasingly common, I suspect in part because people now spend so much time in the solipsist’s paradise of the Internet that they carry its illusion of invisible (and inaudible) omniscience back with them out into the real world.

<post href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2012/11/20/165528528/the-reality-of-reality-may-not-be-reality" time="2012-11-21T03:45:15Z" description="Are You A Simulation? : 13.7: Cosmos And Culture : NPR" extended="Back in 2003 Bostrom wrote an article imaginatively titled &quot;Are You Living In A Computer Simulation.&quot; Bostrom wanted to consider technologically mature civilizations, which for him meant cultures so advanced they build super-duper computers with fully conscious simulated minds living inside simulated realities. Think The Sims on super-duper steroids. These cultures, Bostrom reasoned, might then create ancestor simulations on their computers, meaning simulations of their own past. With these ideas in mind, Bostrom then made the final leap by considering the truth, or falsehood, of three statements:

Almost all civilizations at our level of development become extinct before becoming technologically mature.
The fraction of technologically mature civilizations that are interested in creating ancestor simulations is almost zero.  
You are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.
So watch what happens as we run down the truth/falsehood list of these statements. If 1 is true then virtually no civilization becomes super-high tech before dying, which kind of stinks. If 1 is false but 2 is true, then virtually no ancestor simulations should exist. The use of &quot;virtually&quot; is important here because Bostrom's purely philosophical argument relies on probabilities and, in the end, it leads him to a remarkable place.

Now let's say statement 1 is false. That would means there are civilizations reaching heights of technology we can barely imagine today. Then add statement 2 as false. That would mean some of these technologically mature civilizations start creating super-duper simulations of their own past. With statement 1 and statement 2 false the conclusion has to be that there must exist ancestor simulations running out there right now full of simulated ancestor minds.

Armed dolphins, trained by the US military to shoot terrorists and pinpoint spies underwater, may be missing in the Gulf of Mexico.
Experts who have studied the US navy's cetacean training exercises claim the 36 mammals could be carrying 'toxic dart' guns. Divers and surfers risk attack, they claim, from a species considered to be among the planet's smartest. The US navy admits it has been training dolphins for military purposes, but has refused to confirm that any are missing.&quot;

Yield: 1 bowl
Cooking Time: 17 minutes

Ingredients:
1/2 cup quinoa
1 1/2 cups organic broccoli (chilled, from bag)
1 cube vegetable bullion
Braggs Liquid Aminos
Extra virgin olive oil
Sea salt

Preparation:

Fill medium saucepan with about an inch of fresh water.
Set pan on stove, light a nice hot flame add several dashes of sea salt.
Look at the quinoa. It’s like sand, this quinoa. It’s real real tight little grains, but it’s going to puff up.
Unwrap bullion cube, bust it up with a small knife, and let it wait there. It’ll be happy waiting right there.
When water comes to a boil, add quinoa and cover pan with lid. Reduce heat and simmer for 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, retrieve broccoli from refrigerator and set aside, then fill a fine crystal wine glass—one given to you by Agnes and Maya from Łódź, Poland—with red wine, ‘cause this is what you do when you’re making quinoa. Go outside, sit, take a smoke and think about all the little quinoas bubbling away in the pan.
Add broccoli, cover and let cook for an additional 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, go back outside and tell the story about the train with the coal-burning engine that stopped in a barren, dust-filled landscape on a moonless Yugoslavian night in 1965.

I find myself using the module pattern more often these days. The logic is shielded from the global scope by a function wrapper (usually self-invoking) which returns an object representing the module’s public interface. By immediately invoking the function and assigning the result to a namespace variable, we lock up the module’s API in the namespace. Additionally any variables not included in the return value will remain forever private, visible only to the public functions that reference them.

Like the object literal example above, the receiving namespace can be easily switched, but there are added advantages: object literal notation is rigid – its all about property assignments, with no room for supporting logic. Moreover all properties must be initialized and property values cannot easily cross reference one another (so, for example, internal closures are not possible). The module pattern suffers none of these constraints and gives us the added benefit of privacy." tag="programming development namespacing javascript" hash="0a3c965dd683c56469e93c14a321ba4a" meta="ceb03e6a364e191a5a367ef6dcdaba43"    />

- Light/dark sensor: Ambient light detection
- Device orientation &amp; motion sensor: from built-in accelerometer
- Proximity sensor: device closeness to other objects or people
- Audio sensor: input from a microphone
- Image &amp; video sensors: capture/input from a camera (all kinds of signals can be found in real-time visual information)

He doesn’t think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It’s perfectly healthy — encouraged, even — to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today.
He’s observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they’d already solved. They’re open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking.
This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a well formed point of view, but it means you should consider your point of view as temporary." tag="advice business" hash="ac6c32a33527b61f66152b734afd18af" meta="40b62a2856c13ccda850bc74042943f5"    />

The programming &quot;environment&quot; is the part that's installed on the computer. The programming &quot;language&quot; is the part that's installed in the programmer's head.

This essay presents a set of design principles for an environment and language suitable for learning.

The environment should allow the learner to:

read the vocabulary -- what do these words mean?
follow the flow -- what happens when?
see the state -- what is the computer thinking?
create by reacting -- start somewhere, then sculpt
create by abstracting -- start concrete, then generalize

The language should provide:

identity and metaphor -- how can I relate the computer's world to my own?
decomposition -- how do I break down my thoughts into mind-sized pieces?
recomposition -- how do I glue pieces together?
readability -- what do these words mean?" tag="code learning programming computers" hash="09f1389be2d38a5823c7d40d6358be2c" meta="4118a10f9b6fa2c49fc97dcfeb8f8b31"    />

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound linguiÃ§a (Portuguese sausage), sliced into 1/2-inch rounds
1 pound chouriÃ§o (Spanish sausage), sliced into 1/2-inch rounds
2 large Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled &amp; diced
2 large Red Bliss potatoes, diced
1/4 cup chopped parsley
1 (14-ounce) can kidney beans, drained &amp; rins
4 quarts chicken stock
2 bay leaves
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 pound kale, well washed, stemmed, and torn into bite-size pieces
1 loaf crusty Portuguese bread

Heat the olive oil in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the sausage, garlic and onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until onions are translucent. Add the parsley and the chicken stock and bring to a boil.

Add the bay leaves, thyme and crushed red pepper. Add the potatoes and kale. Simmer until the potatoes are tender, about another 30 minutes. Skim off any fat that rises to the surface. Remove the bay leaves.

To serve, pour the soup into individual soup bowls and serve with the bread." tag="soup food recipes sausage meat chorizo portugal" hash="8afd986c13c0f39a4e54f050270b0ac9" meta="d56393257c6131727e1b4e40e0859da6"    />

12 ounce ribeye
2 tbsp of unsalted butter
2 cloves of garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
a willingness to consume animal flesh


Method

Warm a large skillet over medium heat. Stand the ribeye up on one of its sides and cook for 2 min, or until lightly browned. Repeat that on the other side.

Lay the ribeye flat and cook for 3 more minutes. Flip it and cook for about 2 minutes. Then, remove the steak from the skillet.

Add the butter and minced garlic to the pan. Let the butter melt a bit. Add the steak back to the skillet on the least cooked side. Sprinkle it with salt and pepper.

Next, baste the steak in the garlic butter continuously for about 2 minutes.
Flip it and sprinkle it with more salt and pepper. Baste it for another minute, and then put it on a plate to rest for about five minutes.

Eat your juicy ass steak with some greens or steamed veggies." tag="food recipes steak meat cooking butter" hash="a90be25806cef1869945c0048e9ddfdf" meta="b6de07914b8a3f97217b614342f93de5"    />

1. Treat our data like it matters. Keep it secure and protect our privacy, of course—but also maintain serious backups and respect our choice to delete any information we’ve contributed.

2. No upload without download. Build in export capabilities from day one.

3. If you close a system, support data rescue. Provide one financial quarter’s notice between announcing the shutdown and destroying any user-contributed content, public or private, and offer data export during this period. And beyond that three months? Make user-contributed content available for media-cost purchase for one year after shutdown." tag="ux security data" hash="5f0463aecd0ecff6ca14dfb2a53082f4" meta="df58ed70db6bce6d48d0dc1feecbc297"    />

Foundling wheels were taken out of use in the late 19th century but a modern form, the baby hatch, began to be introduced again from 1952 and since 2000 has come into use in many countries, notably in Germany where there are around 80 hatches and in Pakistan where there are over 300 today." tag="wikipedia babies germany" hash="ac6543c56acbdc16c3ed50b275ea5126" meta="0e25e3d0755e5080c9fb15e0de73d6ce"    />

Gin (The Balk Family prefers Tanqueray, but feel free to use your brand of choice. I would avoid Bombay Sapphire, however; the saltiness that makes it so exquisite in a Martini does not play well with the tang of the tonic and bite of the Campari in this drink.)
Tonic
Campari
Ice
Lime

DIRECTIONS
1. Pour gin and tonic over ice into a highball glass. I have a heavy hand, and tend to pour a ratio of 1:1 when it comes to gin and tonic, but that does not go over well with everyone, and, come to think of it, I have never served this drink without at least one person ending up in tears, which may have something to do with the large amount of gin. Use your best judgment.

2. Add a splash of Campari. How much is a splash? Generations of Balks have debated this very subject with Talmudic levels of interpretation. You will eventually find your own metric, but for now do this: Fill the cap of the Campari bottle to the top, and dump it into the drink.

3. Give it one quick yet gentle stir.

4. Squeeze the lime into the drink and then garnish. Always lime, never lemon. (There is a possibly apocryphal tale about a relative who once attempted to use an orange, only to be drummed out of the family, but the story has never been verified and I have never had the urge to see how such an unorthodox and disturbing idea would play out in practice. You don't mess with perfection.)

5. Sit back, relax and watch your summer go by like every summer before has, borne aloft on the wings of alcohol and its boon of temporary forgetfulness. I mean, yeah, you could probably do the same thing with beer, but this is much much better. Enjoy!" tag="drinks recipes gin" hash="38af75b7db91455da0a479e3a55d46b9" meta="e4c2e5d2a2cd3d9c3d68e1e6ca795fcb"    />

1 1/2 cups flour, plus more for dusting
6 tablespoons butter, divided, plus more for greasing
4 tablespoons lard
3 tablespoons ice water, plus more as needed
3 medium onions, thinly sliced
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 cup boiling water
1/2 pound Lancashire cheese, grated (Cheddar or Cantal also work)
Milk, to seal and glaze.
Salt
PREPARATION

1.
Combine the flour and a large pinch of salt in a large bowl. Add 4 tablespoons butter and the lard, and use your fingers to gently rub the fat into the flour until it has the texture of coarse bread crumbs.
2.
Mix in just enough ice water to bind the mixture, about 3 tablespoons, and lightly knead the dough until well combined and smooth. When you can mold the mixture into a ball, do so. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes &amp;amp;mdash; or freeze for 10 &amp;amp;mdash; to ease rolling.
3.
Heat the oven to 350. Add 2 tablespoons butter to a large skillet over low heat. When the butter melts, add the onions, a pinch of salt and the ground white pepper; cook slowly for about 10 minutes, never browning.
4.
Turn the heat to medium and slowly pour in the water. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid cooks off, about 10 minutes. Remove the onions from the pan and place them on a plate to cool
5.
Grease the bottom of a 9-inch pie dish and sprinkle a countertop with flour. Unwrap the dough and divide it into two balls, one twice as big as the other. Put them on the surface and sprinkle the tops with flour. Using light pressure, roll each one from the center outward, adding more flour as needed and turning them over once or twice during the process. When the larger ball is roughly 10 inches in diameter, gently move it into the pie dish and press it firmly into the bottom and sides. Prick it all over with a fork.
6.
Layer the onions and cheese on top of the dough in the dish, then carefully cover with the remaining dough &amp;amp;mdash; it should be about 8 inches in diameter. Press the edges together, gently but firmly, and brush the top and edges with milk. Use a knife to make 3 small incisions in the top of the crust so steam can escape.
7.
Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake until the crust is nicely browned and the insides are bubbly, 45 minutes to an hour. Cool a bit before slicing into wedges and serving.

I like to make cold-brew with a medium roast, as I find it tastes more like coffee and less like the roasting process than dark or French roast. Light roasts tend to be too acidic. As with any kind of coffee brewing, it’s best to grind the beans yourself just before using them. The ratio of water to coffee is 1:1 by volume and roughly 4:1 by weight, so feel free to scale the recipe to suit your needs. If you don’t have a French press you can make the coffee in a pitcher and strain it through a fine-mesh strainer, and finally through a coffee filter, as in step 2.

3½ cups finely ground medium roast coffee (see note)
Kosher salt (optional)

1. Stir together coffee and 3½ cups room-temperature water in large French press. Allow raft of ground coffee to form, about 10 minutes, and stir again to incorporate. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 24 hours (an hour shorter or longer is fine).

2. Using French press plunger, press firmly on grinds to separate them from concentrate. Pour coffee concentrate into coffee filter-lined fine-mesh strainer set over large measuring cup. Let sit until concentrate filters through, up to 30 minutes. (You should have about 2 cups of coffee concentrate; concentrate can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days).

3. Combine ½ cup coffee concentrate, ½ cup cold water, and pinch Kosher salt (if using) and pour into glass with ice. Drink." tag="coffee recipes coldbrew food drinks" hash="acf5a455b23dccd10a4b1c80990b4aef" meta="c85db2fa0cb1ce286f2a1a053c4dc5ba"    />

It was inspired by Shaun Inman’s Widon’t plugin for Wordpress. This document describes jQWidon’t version 0.1.

To quote Mr Inman:

For those who don’t know, in typesetting, a widow is a single word on a line by itself at the end of a paragraph and is considered bad style." tag="jquery plugin typography" hash="5ab95ca1b719bdde75c9913af34a2535" meta="1ff2ab02b97ac1a8f3c3abe95e6892a9"    />

Place them in a blender with the cayenne peppers. Add 2 tbsp. of mineral oil, 2 cups hot water and 3 tsp. of natural liquid soap. Place the lid on the blender and process on high speed for two to three minutes, or until pureed. Allow the hot pepper spray mixture to stand overnight, which will increase the heat and effectiveness of the solution.

In the morning, put on a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands. This mixture can irritate the skin, so be careful while handling. Strain the liquid through a piece of cheesecloth (or nylon pantyhose) into a glass pint-sized canning jar. Secure the lid tightly and store in a cool, dry place for up to 90 days.

Using Hot Pepper Spray
To use, measure 1/4 cup of the mixture and transfer to a clean spray bottle. Add about 5 cups of water and shake well to combine. Spray directly onto plants as necessary, being careful not to get any of the liquid on your skin. It's a good idea to wear gloves any time you are handling the hot pepper spray. You can make a larger batch to use in a garden sprayer for larger pest problems. Just stick to the formula above of 1/4 cup of solution to every five cups of water." tag="gardening pests insects diy" hash="f7573e811a759dd826e2192f0e05f618" meta="0d245e9b011e629012329e240a696402"    />

1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, sliced
75g pancetta, cubed
250g dried spaghetti
2 eggs and 1 egg yolk
25g pecorino romano, finely grated
25g parmesan, finely grated
Freshly ground black pepper
Nutmeg, optional

1. Put two bowls into a low oven to keep warm, or boil a kettle and half fill them with hot water. Heat the oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, then add the garlic and cook until well coloured, then remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and discard. Add the pancetta and cook until translucent and golden, but not brown around the edges.

2. Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling, salted water until al dente. In a bowl, beat together the eggs and the extra yolk and then stir in the the pecorino and most of the parmesan, reserving a little for garnish. Grind in plenty of black pepper.

3. Scoop out a small cupful of the pasta cooking water, and then drain the pasta well. Tip it into the frying pan and toss to coat with the pancetta fat.

4. Take the pan off the heat and tip in the egg mixture, tossing the pasta furiously, then, once it's begun to thicken, add a dash of cooking water to loosen the sauce. Toss again, and divide between the warm bowls, finishing off with a grating of nutmeg and a little more parmesan.

Frittatas are typically made on the stove in a skillet, but preparing them in a bundt pan offers a convenient and beautiful alternative. Serve as part of a hearty lunch or Sunday brunch.

1 tsp. butter
2 cups grated white cheddar
1 small bunch chives, coarsely chopped
Salt
20 spears asparagus, trimmed
12 eggs, lightly beaten
2 small yellow onions, peeled and chopped
2 small carrots, peeled, trimmed, and finely grated
1 cup self-rising flour
1 cup milk
1⁄4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper

1. Preheat oven to 375°. Grease a 12-cup bundt pan with butter; set aside. Mix 1/2 cup of the cheese and 1 tsp. of the chives together in a small bowl and set aside.

2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat and cook asparagus until tender, 3–4 minutes. Drain; cool under cold running water, then pat dry. Cut asparagus into 1/4&quot;-thick pieces and transfer to a large bowl. Add eggs, onions, carrots, flour, milk, remaining 1 1/2 cups cheese, 1 tsp. salt, and pepper, and mix well. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake until firm, about 45 minutes. Allow frittata to cool in pan on a wire rack.

3. Preheat broiler. Invert frittata onto a sheet pan. Sprinkle top with cheese and chives, and broil until cheese just melts, 1–2 minutes.

INGREDIENTS
½ cup crème fraîche
2 tbsp. minced chives
2 tbsp. capers, drained
2 large russet potatoes
8 tbsp. clarified butter (See how to make clarified butter)
1 tsp. sesame seeds
1 tsp. poppy seeds
Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste
4 oz. smoked salmon
¼ small red onion, thinly sliced

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Mix crème fraîche, chives, and capers in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper and refrigerate until ready to use.

2. Peel and grate potatoes using the large holes on a cheese grater or cut into matchsticks using a mandoline. Heat 4 tbsp. clarified butter in a 10&quot; nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Toss potatoes with seeds and salt and pepper; add to pan and stir to coat potatoes with butter. Using a spatula, gently press potatoes into a flat round, molding to fit skillet; cook, shaking skillet occasionally, until edges are golden and crisp, about 10 minutes.

3. Place a plate, turned upside down, over skillet and invert skillet with plate, allowing potato cake to fall onto plate; slide potato cake back into skillet. Pour remaining butter around edges of potato cake and continue cooking until potatoes are crisp on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and season with salt and pepper. Place smoked salmon and onion evenly over surface and cut into wedges. Place a dollop of the crème fraîche mixture on top of each wedge before serving." tag="recipes saveur food breakfast fish potatoes" hash="4eada9e89fdea222bb06898f73535914" meta="70428eb42d71cd5130aff04afd08ba68"    />

These fields include astrophysics, which has revealed how planets and stars form, interact and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales, and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia.

All predictions of the future of the Earth, the Solar System and the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time. Stars must eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out; close encounters will gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies. Eventually, matter itself will come under the influence of radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. However, as current data suggest that the Universe is flat, and thus will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, the infinite future potentially allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of a Boltzmann brain.

These timelines cover events from roughly eight thousand years from now to the farthest reaches of future time. A number of alternate future events are listed to account for questions still unresolved, such as whether humans survive, whether protons decay or whether the Earth will be destroyed by the Sun's expansion into a red giant." tag="future physics science wikipedia rad timeline" hash="bd74ca8c1827a94584d4a1849d3b06e8" meta="40ff8a15320192da0c5c59af70ef667f"    />

Referring to events or interviews as being a &quot;chore&quot; means that the event/interview has been &quot;kayfabed&quot; or staged, or is part of a wrestling angle while being passed off as legitimate.

Bread is a staple in my kitchen, too, but like many households we often don’t finish a loaf before it becomes hard and stale. That presents an opportunity, not a problem: Mediterranean cooks long ago figured out just how much you can do with stale bread. People who have survived on little never throw out food that can be eaten.  As long as it’s not moldy, bread that has dried out can be reconstituted in thick vegetable soups, pungent salads and comforting, savory bread puddings. I’m particularly fond of stale bread used with tomatoes — now is a perfect time to take advantage of the last few weeks of this summer’s bounty.  Choose breads that are made at least partially with whole wheat flour or other whole grains. They’ll be higher in fiber and such nutrients as selenium, potassium and magnesium. Be aware that cutting hard bread is a bit dangerous; the knife can slip off the hard surface, and a serrated bread knife makes a nasty cut. If your stale bread is too hard to cut easily, douse it with water first. You can even plunge it into a bowl of water for about 20 to 30 seconds, then lift it out and squeeze gently.

Only two genera of Lumbricid earthworms are indigenous to North America while introduced genera have spread to areas where earthworms did not formerly exist, especially in the north where forest development relies on a large amount of undecayed leaf matter. When worms decompose that leaf layer, the ecology may shift making the habitat unsurvivable for certain species of trees, ferns and wildflowers. Another possible ecologic impact of greater earthworm numbers: larger earthworms (e.g. the night crawler, Lumbricus terrestris, and the Alabama jumper, Amynthas agrestis) can be eaten by adult salamanders, and when the salamanders do consume the earthworms they are more successful at reproduction. However, those earthworms are too large for juvenile salamanders to consume, which leads to a net loss in salamander population. Currently there is no economically feasible method for controlling invasive earthworms in forests. Earthworms normally spread slowly, but can be quickly introduced by human activities such as construction earthmoving, or by fishermen releasing bait, or by plantings.

The most important thing to realize about the future is that it's a choice. People choose which visions to pursue, people choose which research gets funded, people choose how they will spend their careers.

Despite how it appears to the culture at large, technology doesn't just happen. It doesn't emerge spontaneously, like mold on cheese. Revolutionary technology comes out of long research, and research is performed and funded by inspired people.

And this is my plea — be inspired by the untapped potential of human capabilities. Don't just extrapolate yesterday's technology and then cram people into it.

Makes: 9 to 12  
8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, plus a little more for greasing the pan  
3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, roughly chopped  
1 cup sugar  
2 eggs  
1/2 cup all-purpose flour  
Pinch salt  
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, optional  

1. Heat the oven to 350°F. Grease a square baking pan with butter or line it by overlapping 2 pieces of parchment paper or aluminum foil crosswise and grease the lining.  

2. Combine the stick of butter and the chocolate in a small saucepan over very low heat, stirring occasionally. (Or microwave them in a large microwave-safe bowl on medium for 10-second intervals, stirring after each.) When the chocolate is just about melted, remove the saucepan from the heat (or bowl from the microwave) and continue to stir until the mixture is smooth.  

3. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl (or use the bowl you put in the microwave) and stir in the sugar. Then beat in the eggs, one at a time. Gently stir in the flour, salt, and the vanilla if you’re using it.  

4. Pour and scrape the mixture into the prepared pan and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until just barely set in the middle. Cool on a rack until set. If you used parchment, lift it out to remove the brownies. If not, cut them in squares right in the pan. Store, covered, at room temperature, for no more than a day.  

Tips:  If you use parchment paper (or foil) to line the pan, leave an extra inch or two overhanging each end. When the brownies are cool, grab each flap and lift them out of the pan.  Err on the side of underbaking: An overcooked brownie is dry and cakey, while an undercooked brownie is gooey and delicious.  

Variations  

Nutty Brownies: In Step 3, substitute 1/4 cup finely ground hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts, or pecans (use the food processor or blender to grind them) for 1/4 cup of the flour and add 1 cup lightly toasted, roughly chopped nuts to the batter. 

Cocoa Brownies: After the brownies cool a bit but are still warm, put 2 tablespoons cocoa in a small strainer and shake it over the pan to dust the tops of the brownies.

2 tbsp. unsalted butter 
2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil 
2 large shallots, thinly sliced 
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 
2 tbsp. poppy seeds 
½ cup white wine 
½ cup buttermilk

1 lb. tagliatelle or fettucine 
2 oz. prosciutto, thinly sliced 
½ cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more to garnish 
4 scallions, cut into ½″ slices

INSTRUCTIONS 

Heat butter and oil in a 12″ skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until soft, about 2 minutes. Add poppy seeds; cook, stirring, until fragrant and shallots begin to brown lightly, about 3 minutes. Add wine; cook until almost all liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Add buttermilk and cream; cook, stirring, until reduced slightly, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil; add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 7 minutes. Drain pasta, reserving a little cooking water, and add to sauce in skillet.

1 2-lb. whole rainbow trout or red snapper, scaled, gutted, and cleaned 
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 
3 sprigs thyme 
2 sprigs flat-leaf parsley 
½ lemon, sliced into thin rounds 
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil 
2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice  

INSTRUCTIONS 

1. Heat oven to 450°. Season the trout cavity with salt and pepper, and stuff it with the thyme, parsley, and lemon slices. Using kitchen twine, tie the trout crosswise with 2 lengths of twine, spacing them 2″ apart. Rub the trout with 1 tbsp. oil, and then transfer them to an aluminum foil—lined baking sheet. Bake trout, turning once with a metal spatula, until cooked through and golden brown on the outside, about 15 minutes. 

2. Meanwhile, whisk the remaining oil with the juice in a small bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Remove the twine from the trout, and cut away the filets. Transfer the filets to serving plates, and drizzle with sauce before serving. " tag="fish recipes food saveur" hash="68c90584a91a393bdb0a3c871940d01c" meta="9922b58142dd729f7bd6790bf207d1ec"    />

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters — including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText — the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.  To this end, Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like *emphasis*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you’ve ever used email.

Outside they’re yelling about the secret weapon. 
But I can still judge the season 
by the unhidden dandelions all over the front yard.  

Also the tricycles, which is to say 
that I face the future ludicrous &amp; unafraid. 
Once I occupied a picnic table for a whole afternoon  

&amp; people came by, asked if it was okay to sit down.  
My responses varied with the color of their eyes, 
which is different than yesterday at the coffee shop 

where I spent all my energy trying to convince you to sit 
anywhere else. Not right next to me. Not 
putting your adult espionage thriller on the table  

where my drink goes. Outside, they’re always yelling 
about the secret weapon. 
I folded my old tattersall shirt &amp; put it in a box.  

The sleeves were fraying &amp; I was embarrassed 
to part with it. We give up on worn out things 
when instead we should celebrate &amp; covet their injuries.  

I shoved sadness deep into my ears to drown
 out the sizzling of dinner. I spent forty minutes 
stacking books on the new bookshelf &amp; each volume  

generated such an impressive floral infused gust, 
I had to wonder about the previous owner. I had to wonder 
about the Nate Pritts from fifteen years ago,  

the one who bought a bottle of his ex-girlfriend’s perfume
just to have it in case all beauty suddenly ceased. 
It did. Then it started again " tag="poetry literature poems" hash="5adf6705ec916d9ff0362dc2953c814f" meta="2fd58eeb0aa2961bec64e319a957aa0a"    />

Garlic Butter (optional) * Stick of butter * minced garlic * herb of preference, (chives, parsley, cilantro etc)
Get steak that's at least 1 inch in thickness, bring it out to room temperature an hour before you cook. Let it rest the first half, and salt the crap out of it the second half. Make sure you use kosher salt. The osmosis method makes the steak super tender and evenly flavored instead of just the outer part. Don't worry, it's not going to be too salty. When you're ready to cook, rinse the steak and pat SUPER dry. Pepper it to taste.
Turn on the vent, fan and possibly open a window - it is going to get smokey.
Turn the heat up on the cast iron to med-high. It's going to take a good 7-8 minutes to raise the temperature of the cast iron to desired heat level. To test the correct temperature, sprinkle some water on the iron, and if the water drops jump around instead of instantly evaporizing, then its ready. I use canola oil because it can take higher heat temps, drizzle some in, and lay the end of the steak closest to you first to avoid hot oil hitting you.
Get a timer and set it to 3-4 minutes per side, depending on thickness and how well you like it done. DO NOT TOUCH in between the flips. Doing so you will lose the amazing crust.
While you're waiting for the skillet to heat up, cut up your butter into slices or cubes. Mince some garlic and fresh herbs and mash it with the cut up butter. Add a pinch of salt if you like. When the steak is ready, plate it hot side up and scoop some butter on top and get ready for some mighty goodness.
Bon Apetit! " tag="steaks cooking food castiron recipes" hash="da23faedbd65490f319ef5336073118c" meta="6935d58f8b8aa743d4a6dd94b8f70f9b"    />

Beef Stock 12  1⁄2&quot;-thick slices baguette 2 cloves garlic, smashed 6 cups grated gruyère cheese 2 cups finely grated parmigiano-reggiano 1. Heat oven to 425°. Combine wine, 1⁄2 cup of the sherry, 8 tbsp. of the butter, sugar, onions, and salt and pepper in a 9&quot; × 13&quot; casserole dish and braise, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the onions just begin to brown, 40–45 minutes. Remove casserole from oven, cover with foil, and continue braising in oven, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, about 1 hour more. Keep the onions warm. 2. Meanwhile, tie parsley, thyme, and bay leaves together with kitchen twine to make a bouquet garni. Put bouquet garni and stock into a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Remove and discard bouquet garni. Stir in remaining sherry and cook for 5 minutes more. 3. While the broth simmers, spread the baguette slices with the remaining butter. Toast in a skillet over medium heat, turning once, until golden, 5–7 minutes. Rub the slices generously with garlic and set aside. Discard any remaining garlic. 4. Heat broiler with rack 6&quot; from element. Arrange 6 heatproof bowls on a foil-lined sheet tray, divide onions and broth between bowls, and stir together. Place 2 baguette slices in each bowl; top each with about 1 cup gruyère and about 1⁄3 cup parmigiano. Broil until cheeses are browned and bubbly, 3–5 minutes. Serve immediately.

1. In a frying pan, fry chorizo slices in olive oil over medium heat until crisp. Remove from pan, and sweat the onions in the sausage fat. 2. In a large pot boil kale and potatoes in chicken stock for 15-20 minutes. When potatoes are tender, add onions and puree the mixture with a hand mixer. You may alternatively boil the potatoes separately in water and add after pureeing in order to retain their shape. 3. Add chorizo and season to taste with salt and pepper.

serves about 4, can be easily multiplied

3 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed (I had 2lbs total after peeling and cubing)

2 tablespoons butter

1 1/2 tablespoons flour

1/2 sweet onion, diced (about 1/2 cup chopped)

2 garlic cloves, minced

2 1/2-3 cups low-sodium vegetable stock

1 1/2-2 cups low-sodium chicken stock

1/2 cup milk

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon pepper

1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika

for garnishes: bacon, mascarpone cheese, crumbled goat cheese &amp; crispy shallots

Prepare potatoes: peel and cube sweet potatoes, then add to a microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high power for about 10 minutes or until fork tender, tossing 2-3 times during cook time. If you do not want to use the microwave, throw the potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper (you can omit/add less salt and pepper later if this is the case) and roast at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes. Using the microwave will help this soup come together in 30 minutes. Roasting the sweet potatoes adds a bit more “caramely,” deep flavor.

Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Add butter and diced onions and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute more, then add flour and whisk continuously to create a roux with the onions. Cook the onion roux for about 2-3 minutes, until it starts to golden in color a bit and smell nutty. Add in stock, milk, smoked paprika and potatoes, then bring to a boil. Simmer for 15-20 minutes over medium heat, stirring often – especially scraping the bottom. The potatoes will begin to bread down at this time – if they are not as broken down as you’d like, mash a bit more with a fork. Turn heat down to low and add salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings according to preference. If you’d prefer a thinner soup, add more stock to thin it out. You can also throw the soup in the blender to make it super creamy.

Serve hot with garnishes of crumbled bacon, mascarpone cheese, goat cheese, and crisped shallots.

Note: to crisp the shallots, I sliced 2 whole shallots very thinly, add a little canola oil over medium-high heat, and once hot added the shallots. I cooked them for about 2 minutes, then removed with a slotted spoon and let drain on a paper towel. So good.

<post href="http://www.jasonandshawnda.com/foodiebride/archives/970" time="2011-10-20T18:41:46Z" description="Butternut Squash Soup Recipe | Confections of a Foodie Bride" extended="Ingredients

2 1/2 lbs butternut squash
32 oz vegetable broth
1/8 tsp cayenne
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
3 Tbsp unsalted butter, divided
1/2 cup walnuts, rough chopped
1 Tbsp fresh sage, chopped
1 9-oz package cheese ravioli, cooked and drained
Molasses, for garnish
Instructions

Make the soup: Peel the squash, halve lengthwise and scoop the seeds. Dice squash into 3/4 inch pieces.
In a large sauce pan, combine squash, broth, cayenne, cinnamon, and salt. Cook covered over medium heat until squash is tender, about 30 minutes.
Transfer 1/3 of the squash mixture to a blender/food processor and puree until smooth (I don't have an immersion blender... if you have one, this would be a great time to bust it out.) Repeat with remaining squash. Return squash mixture to the pan. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 10 minutes. Whisk in 1 Tbsp butter. Taste for seasoning and adjust - I thought it needed a generous pinch of salt. (To freeze: cool the soup and then divide it among 6 freezer bags and freeze flat in the freezer.)
Make the walnuts: Preheat oven to 325. Rough chop walnuts and spread on a small baking sheet. Roast until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Melt 2 Tbsp butter in a small sauce pan over medium heat. When the butter begins to brown, add sage and remove from heat. Toss sage browned butter with toasted walnuts.
Serve: Ladle soup into individual bowls. Divide cooked ravioli between the bowls. Drizzle with molasses, top with walnuts, and sprinkle with sea salt if desired.
Notes

Yields: 6 servings

It saw you steeling yourself for the job interview, slowly walking home after the late date, tripping over nonexistent impediments on the sidewalk. It saw you wince when the single frigid drop fell from the air-conditioner 12 stories up and zapped you. It saw the bewilderment on your face as you stepped out of the stolen matinee, incredulous that there was still daylight after such a long movie.

The prophecy of more attacks on the United States has not been the case, not yet at least. Bumbling attempts got close — involving underwear and a shoe and a 1993 Nissan Pathfinder — but the actuality has been that terrorist acts on American soil in the succeeding years have been, as always, largely homegrown. So many things were expected to be different that have not been. Time passes, and passes some more. Exigencies of living hammer away impatiently.

3 cups (750ml/about 300g) coarsely chopped raw nuts and/or seeds (I usually use a mixture of almonds, hazelnuts and pumpkin seeds, but use whatever tickles your fancy)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon ground mace (or nutmeg)
1 cup, packed (200g) dark brown sugar
1/2 cup (115g/1 stick) unsalted butter
1/3 cup (80ml) water
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
dried fruit, at your discretion

*if you're not familiar with the difference between quick and regular (also called 'old fashioned') rolled oats, take a look at the pictures here

Preheat the oven to 300F/150C. In a food processor, coffee grinder or blender, grind half the oats to a fine powder. In a large bowl, combine the whole oats, ground oats, nuts, seeds and spices. In a microwave-safe bowl (or in a saucepan over medium heat), combine the brown sugar, butter and water and heat just until the butter has melted and the mixture is bubbly. Stir the mixture together until smooth, then stir in the salt and vanilla. Pour this mixture over the oats and nuts, stirring well to coat (I usually do this with my hands). It should be uniformly moist - stir in another tablespoon or two of water if it isn't. Let stand for about ten minutes.

Spread the mixture out on a large baking sheet, separating it into irregular clumps with your fingers, and allowing space between the clumps for the hot air to circulate. Slide into the middle of the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and stir, gently breaking up the mixture into small-to-medium sized clumps. Return to the oven and bake another 15 minutes or so before stirring again. Repeat the bake-and-stir until the mixture is a uniform golden brown and completely dry; this usually takes 1-1 1/2 hours. Cool completely, then stir in any dried fruit you want to use.

Store in a covered container at room temperature. Serve with milk or plain yogurt and fresh fruit as desired." tag="recipes food granola" hash="de19c896c86e2a6aef2a71acd0f157ef" meta="5794be034567cc214864a9fb9d0cf8d9"    />
